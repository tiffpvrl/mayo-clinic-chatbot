Preparation of the MoviPrep \nsolution: MoviPrep solution is prepared by emptying the contents of 1 pouch A and 1 \npouch B into a suitable glass container (or the container provided) and adding \nto the container 1 liter of lukewarm water.  Mix the solution to ensure that the \ningredients are completely dissolved.  If the patient prefers, the MoviPrep \nsolution can be refrigerated prior to drinking.

      "title": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS",
      "content": "MoviPrep should be used with caution in patients with severe \nulcerative colitis, ileus, gastrointestinal obstruction or perforation, gastric \nretention, toxic colitis, or toxic megacolon General Patients with impaired gag reflex and patients prone to regurgitation or \naspiration should be observed during the administration of MoviPrep.  If a \npatient experiences severe bloating, abdominal distention, or abdominal pain, \nadministration should be slowed or temporarily discontinued until the symptoms \nabate. If gastrointestinal obstruction or perforation is suspected, appropriate \ntests should be performed to rule out these conditions before administration of \nMoviPrep®. Phenylketonurics: MoviPrep contains phenylalanine – a maximum of 2.33 mg of \nphenylalanine per treatment. No additional ingredients (e.g., flavorings) should be added to the MoviPrep \nsolution. Since MoviPrep contains sodium ascorbate and ascorbic acid, MoviPrep should \nbe used with caution in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PD) \ndeficiency especially G-6-PD deficiency patients with an active infection, with \na history of hemolysis, or taking concomitant medications known to precipitate \nhemolytic reactions. 5.1 Seizures There have been rare reports of generalized tonic-clonic seizures \nassociated with use of polyethylene glycol colon preparation products in \npatients with no prior history of seizures.  The seizure cases were associated \nwith electrolyte abnormalities (e.g., hyponatremia, hypokalemia).  The \nneurologic abnormalities resolved with correction of fluid and electrolyte \nabnormalities.  Therefore, MoviPrep should be used with caution in patients \nusing concomitant medications that increase the risk of electrolyte \nabnormalities [such as diuretics or angiotensin converting enzyme \n(ACE)-inhibitors] or in patients with known or suspected hyponatremia.  Consider \nperforming baseline and post-colonoscopy laboratory tests (sodium, potassium, \ncalcium, creatinine, and BUN) in these patients."

      "title": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS",
      "content": "6.1 Clinical Studies Experience In the MoviPrep trials, abdominal distension, anal discomfort, \nthirst, nausea, and abdominal pain were some of the most common adverse \nreactions to MoviPrep administration.  Since diarrhea was considered as a part \nof the efficacy of MoviPrep, diarrhea was not defined as an adverse reaction in \nthe clinical studies.  Tables 1 and 2 display the most common drug-related \nadverse reactions of MoviPrep and its comparator in the controlled MoviPrep \ntrials.

In addition to the recording of \nspontaneous adverse events, patients were also specifically asked about the \noccurrence of the following symptoms: shivering, anal irritations, abdominal \nbloating or fullness, sleep loss, nausea, vomiting, weakness, hunger sensation, \nabdominal cramps or pain, thirst sensation, and dizziness. †     OSPS is Oral Sodium Phosphate Solution Isolated cases of urticaria, rhinorrhea, dermatitis, and anaphylactic \nreaction have been reported with PEG-based products and may represent allergic \nreactions. Published literature contains isolated reports of serious adverse events \nfollowing the administration of PEG-based products in patients over 60 years of \nage. These adverse events included upper gastrointestinal bleeding from a \nMallory-Weiss tear, esophageal perforation, asystole, and acute pulmonary edema \nafter aspirating the PEG-based preparation. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience In addition to adverse events reported from clinical trials, the \nfollowing adverse events have been identified during post-approval use of \nMoviPrep. Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown \nsize, estimates of frequency cannot be made. These events have been chosen for \ninclusion due to either their seriousness, frequency of reporting or causal \nconnection to MoviPrep, or a combination of these factors. General: Hypersensitivity \nreactions including anaphylaxis, rash, urticaria, lip and facial swelling, \ndyspnea, chest tightness and throat tightness."

      "title": "17  PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION",
      "content": "Important Precautions Regarding MOVIPREP MoviPrep produces a watery stool which cleanses the colon before \ncolonoscopy.  It is recommended that patients receiving MoviPrep be advised to \nadequately hydrate before, during, and after the use of MoviPrep. Patients may \nhave clear soup and/or plain yogurt for dinner, finishing the evening meal at \nleast one hour prior to the start of MoviPrep treatment.  No solid food should \nbe taken from the start of MoviPrep treatment until after the \ncolonoscopy. What Patients Should Know About Adverse Reactions The first bowel movement may occur approximately 1 hour after the start of \nMoviPrep administration. Abdominal bloating and distention may occur before the \nfirst bowel movement. If severe abdominal discomfort or distention occurs, stop \ndrinking temporarily or drink each portion at longer intervals until these \nsymptoms disappear. Manufactured by: Norgine \nB.V.
