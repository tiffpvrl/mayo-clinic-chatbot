However, elderly patients are more likely to have decreased hepatic, renal or cardiac function and may be more susceptible to adverse reactions resulting from fluid and electrolyte abnormalities [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] .",

Drink 240 mL (8 oz.) every 10 minutes. Rapid drinking of each portion is better than drinking small amounts continuously. The first bowel movement should occur approximately one hour after the start of GoLYTELY for Oral Solution administration.

Use caution when prescribing CLENPIQ for patients at increased risk of arrhythmias (e.g., patients with a history of prolonged QT, uncontrolled arrhythmias, recent myocardial infarction, unstable angina, congestive heart failure, or cardiomyopathy). Consider pre-dose and post-colonoscopy ECGs in patients at increased risk of serious cardiac arrhythmias. 5.5 Syncope Syncope has been reported with CLENPIQ in the postmarketing setting.",

Use caution when prescribing CLENPIQ for patients at increased risk of arrhythmias (e.g., patients with a history of prolonged QT, uncontrolled arrhythmias, recent myocardial infarction, unstable angina, congestive heart failure, or cardiomyopathy). Consider pre-dose and post-colonoscopy ECGs in patients at increased risk of serious cardiac arrhythmias. 5.5 Syncope Syncope has been reported with CLENPIQ in the postmarketing setting.",

Refill the mixing container to the Fill Line (32 fluid ounces) with a clear liquid and drink all this liquid before going to bed. 6. Consume additional water or clear liquids up to 2 hours before the colonoscopy or as prescribed by your healthcare provider. Then stop drinking liquids until after the colonoscopy.",
