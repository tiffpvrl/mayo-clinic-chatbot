They work by softening your\npoop (stool) so it’s easy to have a bowel movement. The electrolytes in the\nmixture help prevent dehydration. Together, they clean out your colon (large\nintestine) to prepare it for a colonoscopy. Why is bowel prep important? Bowel prep completely clears your colon of stool.",

The studies do show that relatively high doses of corticosteroids are necessary to demonstrate a significant effect (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). An acute myopathy has been observed with the use of high doses of corticosteroids, most often occurring in patients with disorders with neuromuscular transmission (e.g., myasthenia gravis), or in patients receiving concomitant therapy of neuromuscular blocking drugs (eg, pancuronium).",

Consider the potential for mucosal ulcerations when interpreting colonoscopy findings in patients with known or suspected inflammatory bowel disease [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . 5.7 Use in Patients with Significant Gastrointestinal Disease If gastrointestinal obstruction or perforation is suspected, perform appropriate diagnostic studies to rule out these conditions before administering CLENPIQ [see Contraindications (4) ] .",

Growth velocity may therefore be a more sensitive indicator of systemic corticosteroid exposure in pediatric patients than some commonly used tests of HPA axis function. The linear growth of pediatric patients treated with corticosteroids should be monitored, and the potential growth effects of prolonged treatment should be weighed against clinical benefits obtained and the availability of treatment alternatives. In order to minimize the potential growth effects of corticosteroids, pediatric patients should be titrated to the lowest effective dose.",

Instruct patients to take two separate doses in conjunction with liquids, as follows: Dose 1 – On the day before colonoscopy: Instruct patients to consume only clear liquids (no solid food or dairy) on the day before the colonoscopy up until 2 hours before the time of the colonoscopy. Take the first dose (1 bottle) of CLENPIQ during the evening before the colonoscopy (e.g., 5:00 PM to 9:00 PM).",

These occur predominantly in patients with underlying cardiac risk factors and electrolyte disturbances. Use caution when prescribing PLENVU for patients at increased risk of arrhythmias (e.g., patients with a history of prolonged QT, uncontrolled arrhythmias, recent myocardial infarction, unstable angina, congestive heart failure, cardiomyopathy or electrolyte imbalance).",
