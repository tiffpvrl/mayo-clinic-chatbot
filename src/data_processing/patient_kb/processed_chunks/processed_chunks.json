    "content": "Colonoscopy Surveillance after Colorectal Cancer Resection\n© 2016 by the American College of Gastroenterology The American Journal of GASTROENTEROLOGY\nmonths) ( 35 ). A meta-analysis that included 7 RCTs ( 17–23 ) and \npreliminary results of an ongoing RCT ( 27 ) reported comparable fi ndings ( 13 ). Th  is analysis also found that colonoscopy (vs. no \ncolonos- copy) was associated with improved overall survival; however, the frequency of colonoscopy had no signifi  cant eff  ect \non survival ( 13 ). Th  e most recent meta-analysis ( 14 ) included \n11 RCTs and reported that patients undergoing more intensive follow-up had reduced overall mortality (hazard ratio=0.75; 95% CI: 0.66–0.86), higher probability of detection of asympto-\nmatic recurrences (RR=2.59; 95% CI: 1.66–4.06), curative sur-\ngery attempted at recurrences (RR=1.98; 95% CI: 1.51–2.60), survival aft  er recurrences (RR=2.13; 95% CI: 1.24–3.69), and a \nshorter time to detecting recurrences (mean diff  erence, −5.23 \nmonths; 95% CI: −9.58 to −0.88 months). Th  ere was, however, \nno signifi  cant diff  erence in cancer-specifi  c mortality. It is impor-\ntant to note that although intensive multimodality surveillance is associated with increased overall survival and earlier detec-tion of cancer recurrence, these benefi  ts are most apparent in \nstudies using frequent CEA measurements to detect recurrent disease ( 13,14,34–36 ). Th  e performance of radiologic imaging \n(such as CT to detect liver metastases) has been associated with improved overall mortality when compared with no imaging in most ( 14,34–36 ), but not all ( 13 ), analyses. Th  e recently pub-\nlished FACS (Follow Up Aft  er Colorectal Surgery) ( 25 ) RCT \nreported that intensive imaging with CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, and CEA measurement were each associated with increased rates of surgical resection of recurrences with cura-tive intent, but not improved survival compared with minimal follow-up. Conversely, annual or more frequent surveillance colo-noscopy has not been shown to improve survival ( 13,22,26,36 ). Th is is not surprising because the rates of intraluminal or anasto-\nmotic recurrences are low, particularly for cancer proximal to the rectum, and usually associated with  extraluminal disease that is \nnot amenable to curative surgical resection. Increasing the inten-sity of surveillance colonoscopy solely to detect intraluminal disease is unlikely benefi  cial ( 5,36 ). A recently published RCT conducted in China provides addi-\ntional information regarding colonoscopy surveillance aft  er CRC \nresection ( 26 ). In this trial, 326 patients undergoing surgery for CRC were randomized to either intensive colonoscopic surveil-lance (i.e., colonoscopy at 3-month intervals for 1 year, at 6-month intervals for the next 2 years, and once a year subsequently), or routine colonoscopic surveillance (i.e., colonoscopy at 6, 30, and 60 months postoperatively). All patients underwent preoperative colonoscopy (or within 6 months postoperatively), and similar non-colonoscopic surveillance (i.e., medical history and exami-nation, CEA, chest x-ray, and CT or ultrasound of the liver), and \nwere followed until the date of last visit or death. Th  ere were no \ndiff erences in overall 5-year survival rates (77% in the intensive \ncolonoscopic surveillance group vs. 72% in the routine colono-scopic surveillance group; P=0.25). Although the authors stated that intensive colo- noscopic surveillance improved the progno-sis of patients with symptomatic postoperative CRC, others have suggested lead-time bias as explanation ( 37 ). Furthermore, the higher E rate of reoperation has been observed in other studies O and cost. Strong recommendations mean that most informed \npatients would choose the recommended management and that clinicians can structure their interactions with patients accord-ingly.",

    "content": "colonoscopy on the day that it is scheduled. Bowel prepara-\ntion is a multistep process that includes arranging time offfor the procedure, ensuring an escort for safe discharge ac-cording to standards of the endoscopy unit, proper manage-ment of medication regimen (with special emphasis onanticoagulation, anti-platelet agents, glucagon-like peptide-\n1 [GLP-1] receptor agonists, and diabetes and antihyperten-\nsive medications), compliance with dietary modi ﬁcations,\nand the proper timing and complete ingestion of the speci-ﬁed bowel purgative and associated ﬂuids. While not the\nfocus of this study, the appropriate management of anti-thrombotic and anti-platelet medications in the periendo-scopic period has recently been reviewed in separate guide-lines. 10,11The management of anti-hyperglycemic and anti-\nhypertensive agents should be individualized with the assis-\ntance of the prescribing clinician based on the timing of thecolonoscopy and is beyond the scope of this document. The complexity of the bowel preparation process, vari-\nable health literacy and preferred languages, and poten-tially counterproductive information on the internet\n12are\nsome factors that can negatively affect colonoscopycompletion rates. 13–15The use of both verbal and detailedwritten instructions, effective across a range of health liter-\nacy and educational levels, has been associated withimproved bowel preparation compared with written in-structions alone. 16–22Videos when used to augment bowel\npreparation instructions have been shown in some ran-domized controlled trials to improve bowel preparationand the ADR. 23,24For example, the addition of virtual real-\nity videos (compared with more conventional verbal and\nwritten materials) improved both the mean Boston Bowel\nPreparation Scale (BBPS) score (7.6 vs 7.0; PZ0.002) and\nthe detection of adenomas (33% vs 22%) in a single-center,2-arm, randomized controlled trial (N Z346). 23However,\nwhen baseline bowel preparation adequacy rates arealready quite high, there may be a ceiling effect, wherebyadditional education measures offer no bene ﬁt. 25,26\nComparing several studies of enhanced bowel preparation\ninstructions (i.e., more details provided in written and/or\nverbal and/or video format), signi ﬁcant improvements in\nbowel preparation adequacy seem dif ﬁcult to achieve\nwhen the control population ’s rate of bowel preparation\nadequacy already exceeds 89%.27–32TABLE 3. Key concepts\nThe choice of bowel preparation regimen, including the purgative, should take into consideration patient preference, comorbidities, safety (see b elow),\nassociated additional costs to the patient for both prescription and over the counter purgatives and adjuncts, and ease for the patient in obtaining\nand consuming any purgatives or adjuncts. Individuals using a same-day bowel preparation regimen should begin drinking the purgative 4 –6 hr before the time of colonoscopy and complete the\npurgative at least 2 hr before the procedure ’s start. Given the lack of data to strongly support the timing of oral simethicone during the bowel preparation process, and limited data supporting a specific\ndose, the USMSTF recommends that if endoscopists opt to include simethicone in a bowel preparation regimen, a dose of at least 320 mg be used. The impact of simethicone on meaningful clinical outcomes and its efficacy when coupled with various bowel preparation regimens requires further\nstudy. Out of pocket cost to the patient should also be considered when adding simethicone to a regimen. If a colonoscopy is being aborted because of inadequate bowel preparation quality, the endoscopist should photograph the segment(s) of colon that\nresulted in abortion of the procedure. This will aid in quality assurance efforts in the setting of variability in cancellation rates among an endosco py\nunit ’s endoscopists.",

Mobile telephone apps and web-based software systems\nhave also been used to send automated instructions,videos, and text message reminders to help guide patientsthrough the bowel preparation process. 17,28,31,38–43One\nmeta-analysis of 5 studies found that smartphone app\nuse was associated with a higher rate of adequate bowelpreparation compared with standard preparation instruc-tions alone (88% vs 78%; pooled odds ratio [OR] 2.67;95% CI 1.00 –7.13; PZ0.05), although signi ﬁcant hetero-\ngeneity was observed across the studies in part due tomethodologic variation. 44When the analysis was limited\nto studies using the BBPS to grade bowel preparation ade-\nquacy (n Z3 studies), smartphone users (n Z235 sub-jects) had higher mean scores compared with standard\nwritten instructions (n Z240 subjects), with mean BBPS\nscores ranging from 7.5 to 8.1 compared with a range of\n6.3–7.2. This yielded a statistically signi ﬁcant absolute\nmean score difference of 0.9 points ( P<0.01) across the\n3 studies. Importantly, the delivery of instructions in pa-tients ’preferred language, when not English, is associated\nwith improved colonoscopy completion rates andimproved bowel preparation quality. Topic: Diet During the Bowel Preparation\nProcess\nQuestion: When and how should diets be altered\nbefore colonoscopy? Recommendations:\n/C15We recommend limiting dietary modifications to the\nday before colonoscopy for ambulatory patients atlow risk for inadequate bowel preparation (strongrecommendation, high-quality evidence). /C15We recommend dietary modifications should include\nthe use of low-residue and low-fiber foods or fullliquids for the early and midday meals on the daybefore colonoscopy when using a split-dose bowel\npreparation regimen for ambulatory patients at low\nrisk for inadequate bowel preparation (strongrecommendation, high-quality evidence). Dietary modi ﬁcation as a method to improve bowel\npreparation adequacy should be balanced against patientexperience and compliance with the overall preparation\nregimen. Historically, patients were limited to ingesting\nonly clear liquids on the day before colonoscopy, withadditional restrictions varying widely in both speci ﬁcally\nprohibited foods (e.g., seeds, vegetables, and legumes)and number of days during which modi ﬁcations were\nrequired. 46Recent randomized trials, meta-analyses, and\nprospective dietary studies have demonstrated the utilityof simpler, patient-centered dietary regimens, particularly\nwhen split dosing the bowel preparation purgative. Several randomized controlled trials have examined\nwhether alteration in diet is required for more than 1day before colonoscopy.

    "content": "interviews to determine the macronutrients and micronu-\ntrients consumed during the 3 days before colonoscopy.51\nDietary information was then compared with bowel prep-\naration adequacy in the setting of a 4 L, split-dose, polyeth-\nylene glycol (PEG) purgative and con ﬁrmed that foods\nconsumed 2 and 3 days before colonoscopy have noimpact on bowel preparation. Bowel preparation qualitywas positively associated with the intake of gelatin andinversely associated with intake of red meat, poultry, andvegetables on the day before colonoscopy, further sup-porting the use of low-residue, full-liquid, or clear-liquid di-\nets during bowel preparation. One problem with the recommendation of a low-\nresidue diet is the lack of a standardized de ﬁnition. 52A\nlow-residue diet is meant to l imit foods and beverages\nthat result in the undigested material remaining in theGI lumen and that is eventually passed in feces. While di-etary ﬁber contributes to colonic residue, other dietary\nitems such as milk may also contribute to residue if\nconsumed in large quantity. 53A low-residue diet attempts\nto limit high- ﬁber foods such as cereals, beans, peas,\nnuts, seeds, and raw or dried fruits and vegetables.54\nThe term low- ﬁber diet is occasionally used interchange-\nably with low-residue diet, but much of the literature spe-ciﬁcally describes assigning patients to low-residue or low\nresidual diets. A list of low-residue foods associated withadequate bowel preparation quality in several random-\nized trials comparing low-residue with full-liquid or\nclear-liquid diets is provided in Table 5 . 55–60\nSeveral meta-analyses and randomized controlled trials\ndemonstrate that bowel preparation adequacy is not infe-rior when comparing low-residue diets with clear-liquid di-ets before colonoscopy. 61–65The largest and most recent\nsystematic review and meta-analysis included 20 random-ized controlled trials with 4,323 patients. 65There was sig-\nniﬁcant heterogeneity across the included studies in\nbowel purgative used and whether low-residue foodswere permitted for 1, 2, or 3 meals on the day before co-lonoscopy. Analysis of secondary endpoints found no dif-ferences in adenoma and advanced ADRs, but patientsallowed a low-residue diet were more willing to repeatthe preparation (71% vs 62%; PZ0.005), found the diet\neasier to comply with (52% vs 39%; PZ0.01), and experi-\nenced less hunger (25% vs 44%; P<0.001) and nausea\n(18% vs 23%; PZ0.02). For patients at high risk for inadequate bowel prepara-\ntion quality, routine use of a 1-day, low-residue diet maynot be appropriate, and clinicians should offer diet recom-mendations on a case-by-case basis. However, for the ma-jority of individuals, an approach that uses only 1 day vs 2or 3 days of dietary restrictions, and more patient-\nacceptable diets (e.g., low-residue vs strict clear) seems\nwarranted.Topic: Choice of Bowel Preparation Purgative\nQuestion: Is there a speci ﬁc FDA-approved bowel\npreparation purgative that is superior to others,including non-FDA-approved purgatives, in bowelpreparation adequacy? Recommendation:\n/C15We do not recommend 1 bowel preparation purgative\nas superior to others about bowel preparationadequacy for ambulatory patients at low risk forinadequate bowel preparation (strongrecommendation, high-quality evidence). In the last version of the USMSTF recommendations,\nwe did not recommend a speci ﬁc bowel preparation pur-\ngative as superior to others in bowel preparation qualityadequacy rate. 66,67The USMSTF remains unable to\nrecommend 1 speci ﬁc bowel preparation as superior\ndespite numerous studies in the ﬁeld. There are very\nfew recent head-to-head comparisons of bowel prepara-tions where the endpoint is superior to one preparation\ncompared with another. Noninferiority designs are more\ncommon in the era of split-dosing preparations given thehigh ( >90%) baseline level of cleanliness achieved by\nmost preparations currently in use.",

Hyperosmolar purgatives for bowel preparation should\nbe avoided in individuals at risk of clinical consequencesfrom ﬂuid shifts, such as renal insuf ﬁciency, or cardiac con-\nditions, such as congestive heart failure. One large meta-\nanalysis of various bowel preparation regimens highlightedthat most preparations can cause abdominal pain andabdominal distention, anal irritation, nausea, headache,dizziness, and malaise. 75It is important to highlight that\nin this analysis, the investigators included studies thatenrolled outpatient patients with various indications for co-lonoscopy, i.e., screening, surveillance, and diagnostic. They excluded those studies with patients who had\ncommonly accepted contraindications for colonoscopyand contraindications for bowel preparation. The authorspoint out that their study did not include those patientswith serious systemic illnesses. Participants receiving sodium picosulfate þmagnesium\ncitrate experienced elevated serum magnesium levels, hy-ponatremia, and hyperkalemia; those receiving PEG þ\nascorbate were more likely to experience hypernatremia;\nand those receiving oral sulfate solution were more likelyto experience metabolic derangements including transientdiminished renal function. 75However, these changes were\ntransient and were of low clinical signi ﬁcance.

One meta-analysis of 11 studies showed\na noninferior ef ﬁcacy for bowel preparation quality but\ngreater compliance with 2 L PEG-ELS þascorbate compared\nwith 4 L PEG-ELS. 78Ascorbate is contraindicated in patients\nwith phenylketonuria or glucose-6-phosphate dehydroge-nase de ﬁciency. 79,80In addition, this purgative should not\nbe used in patients with reduced creatinine clearance ( <30\nmL/min) or in those with congestive heart failure. Since thispurgative is hypertonic, hydration with additional water is rec-\nommended. 79Two liter PEG-ELS þascorbate is approved by\nthe FDA for use as a bowel preparation regimen.

    "content": "their association with PCCRC in recent studies (121,122), and we\nrecommend the SSLDR as the quality indicator of choice becauseit directly measures the precancerous serrated lesion of greatest\ninterest and is not subject to endoscopist bias (Table 10). We acknowledge that the SSLDR is subject to measurement and\naccuracy errors related to pathologist interobserver variation in\ndiﬀerentiation of SSLs from hyperplastic polyps (116 –119). Thus,\nthe SSLDR may re ﬂect pathologist performance and bias rather than\nendoscopist performance in some instances (117). This is a poten-tially serious ﬂaw in endoscopy detection measures (105). However,\nevidence shows that SSL detection is increasing rapidly with time\n(124) and that part of this increase re ﬂects improved awareness and\neducation among community pathologists of identi ﬁcation of SSLs. Further, introducing the SSLDR as a detection target should in-\ncentivize endoscopists to work with their pathologists to improvepathologic identi ﬁcation of SSLs (125). Admittedly, any serrated\ndetection indicator carries inherent ﬂaws for prospective use (105). To set the target threshold for a minimum SSLDR, we examined\nprevalence data on SSLs and the association of SSL detection with\nPCCRC. A systematic review and meta-analysis found a pooled\nSSL prevalence of 2.5% (126). The reported prevalence of SSLsvaries between countries, and the pooled prevalence in the UnitedStates was found to be 4.6% (127). However, evidence of increasing\nSSL prevalence over time is clear (124), with both endoscopist and\npathology factors contributing to the increase. A registry studyfrom the United States involving more than 5.1 million colonos-\ncopies and 3934 endoscopists found that the prevalence of 4.57% in\n2014 increased to 7.14% in 2017 (124). Thus, the prevalence of SSLsas determined by colonoscopic detection is steadily rising. Data suggest SSLDRs may not correlate closely with ADRs and\nthat SSLDRs provide predictive data independent from ADRs,making it a worthy stand-alone quality indicator. A recent studyfrom the Netherlands performed in FIT-positive patients showed\nthat the proximal serrated polyp detection rate (PSPDR) and the\nSSLDR had similar associations with prevention of PCCRC (122). Ina study from Austria, the magnitude of PCCRC mortality reduction\nw a ss i m i l a rf o ri n c r e a s e si nP S P D R sa n dS S L D R s ,b u tt h ee ﬀect on\nmortality reduction did not reach signi ﬁcance for SSLDRs, probably\nbecause SSLs are less prevalent than proximal serrated polyps (123). A greater prevalence is an advantage for PSPDRs as a detection\nm e a s u r ec o m p a r e dw i t hS S L D R s ,b u ti to fn o t et h a to v e rh a l fo fpatients with serrated polyps have t hem only in the distal colon (123),\nwhich could subject PSPDRs to gaming with prospective use. Data\nfrom the New Hampshire Colonoscopy Registry also demonstratedthat SSL detection predicts PCCRC independent of ADRs (128). Theunadjusted risks of PCCRC were 1.4%, 0.6%, 0.6%, 0.4% and 0.3%\nwith SSLDRs of ,1.0%, 1% –,2.0%, 2.0% –,4.0%, 4.0% –,6.0%,\nand$6.0%, respectively. Approximately one-third of endoscopists\n(33.8% [50/148]) had adequate ADRs but SSLDRs ,6%. One challenge with the SSLDR is that the prevalence of SSLs is\nlower than that of conventional adenomas, so that substantial pro-\ncedure volumes will be required for some physicians to determine\nwith con ﬁdence if detection is clearly adequate or suboptimal. This\nthe SSLDR to colonoscopists, with the expectation that the con ﬁ-\ndence interval around the SSLDR will narrow with continuedmeasurement. Assessment and reporting of SSLDR performance\nover longer time periods than used for the ADR may be appropriate. Based on available evidence, we recommend a current mini-\nmum threshold for the SSLDR of 6%. This is expected to be\nrevised upward as evidence of increasing detection occurs.",

    "content": "The recommended minimum average withdrawal time in\nnormal colonoscopies without polypectomy, biopsy sampling, ortherapy re ﬂects the best evidence available regarding the time\nmost colonoscopists need to apply careful and detailed in-\nspection of the colon, from the appendiceal ori ﬁce to completion\nof retro ﬂexion in the rectum. The ﬁrst recommendation for\nwithdrawal time made in 2002 (29) recommended an average of\n6–10 minutes in normal colonoscopies, based on the observation\nof 2 physicians participating in a miss rate study who had meanwithdrawal times of 8 minutes and the lowest observed miss rates\namong 26 endoscopists in the study (131). In 2006, the recom-\nmendation for minimum average withdrawal time was changedto 6 minutes (30) on the basis of a landmark study showing that\nin a group of private practice gastroenterologists performing\ncolonoscopy, 6 minutes of withdrawal time in normal colonos-copies was associated with reasonable separation between high-\nand low-level detectors (26). Since 2006, but particularly since\n2015, considerable evidence has demonstrated that optimal de-tection typically requires at least 8 –9 minutes average withdrawal\ntime in normal colonoscopies (26,83,132 –146) (Table 11). This\nevidence includes retrospective data showing that prevention ofPCCRC is optimized at withdrawal times of at least 8 –9m i n u t e s\n(147). Observational studies suggest that overall detection of\nadenomas is optimized at 8 –9 minutes or longer (26,83,132 –146)\n(Table 11), as is detection of serrated lesions (135,138,142). Aparallel-design randomized trial comparing 6 with 9 minutes\nfound 9 minutes to be superior for detection (145), as did a\nrandomized tandem study comparing adenoma miss rates at 9minutes vs 6 minutes (146).\nImportantly, withdrawal time by itself is not an adequate\nmeasure of detection performance or skill. Rather, the primarymeasures of detection performance are ADR and SSLDR. With-drawal time cannot substitute for ADR or SSLDR. Withdrawal\ntime should be measured and recorded in clinical practice, and if\nADR or SSLDR are low, an accompanying short withdrawal timesuggests inadequate withdrawal technique. Corrective measures\ndesigned to improve ADR and SSLDR should focus on an opti-\nmized examination technique, which consists of systematic at-tempts to expose the mucosa proximal to each haustral fold,\nﬂexure, and valve in the colorectum; achieving adequate disten-\ntion of the colon; and intraprocedural cleansing to expose mu-cosal surfaces covered by ﬂuid collections, bubbles, or particulate\ndebris (148,149). The point is that application of high-quality\ninspection techniques requires an average of at least 8 –9 minutes.\nT h e r ei ss o m ee v i d e n c et h a tm u c o s a l - e x p o s u r ed e v i c e s\n(speciﬁcally Endocu ﬀVision [Olympus, Center Valley, PA])\ncan allow faster examination during withdrawal without com-\npromising detection (150). Add itional study of this concept is\nneeded.\nThe recommendation that the average minimum withdrawal\ntime should be at least 8 –9 minutes in normal colonoscopies\nshould not be translated to mean that best practice or the standard\nof medical care requires that every withdrawal time should last\n$8 minutes. On the other hand, if ADR and/or SSLDR are below\nthe minimum recommended threshold and accompanied by anaverage minimum withdrawal time of ,8 minutes, this could be\nconstrued as evidence of an inadequate withdrawal technique.\nThus, low ADR accompanied by a short average withdrawal timeshould be considered an indication to evaluate and correct the\ninspection technique.Resection indicators\nDocumentation of lesion features and resection method\nindicator",

Linked-color imaging (Fuji ﬁlm, Valhalla, NY) is also as-\nsociated with detection gains for both adenomas and SSLs(328,329). Arti ﬁcial intelligence systems for detection of neo-\nplasia have been recently approved in the United States with most\nrandomized controlled studies demonstrating signi ﬁcant im-\nprovements in ADRs (330 –332) and reductions in adenoma miss\nrates (333). Despite the convincing and consistent evidence from\nrandomized trials, assessments of bene ﬁt in clinical practice set-\ntings have been negative in several instances (334 –336). Gener-\nalizability to routine practice settings remains to be demonstrated\nconvincingly. Successful programmatic colonoscopy quality as-surance e ﬀorts with demonstrated improvements in patient\noutcomes have been outlined from the UK National Bowel\nCancer Screening Proramme (337 –340), the Netherlands (341),\nPoland (316), Germany (342), the US Veterans Administration(343), and Kaiser Permanente Northern California (344).\nIn summary, correction of poor performance begins with\nmeasurements of colonoscopy quality to identify speci ﬁc areas of\nconcern. Quality improvement may depend on the use of mul-\ntifaceted interventions. As a last resort, removal of privileges to\nperform colonoscopy may be appropriate if satisfactory perfor-mance cannot be achieved, because colonoscopy quality is\nstrongly associated with important patient outcomes, such as\nPCCRC incidence and mortality (21,22,92). These recommen-dations hold for colonoscopists in all specialties (345).",

They work by softening your\npoop (stool) so it’s easy to have a bowel movement. The electrolytes in the\nmixture help prevent dehydration. Together, they clean out your colon (large\nintestine) to prepare it for a colonoscopy. Why is bowel prep important? Bowel prep completely clears your colon of stool.",

Notably, the Task Force has recently issued recom-\nmendations for follow-up colonoscopy for individuals with\nLynch syndrome\n4and a personal history of CRC.3,5,6\nRecommendations for follow-up of serrated polyposis syn-\ndrome, management of patients with a malignant polyp, aswell as optimal polypectomy technique will be covered insubsequent Task Force recommendations. Report Format\nThe primary goals of colonoscopy screening and post-\npolypectomy surveillance are to reduce CRC incidenceand mortality. We provide a review of the available evi-dence on the impact of surveillance on these outcomes.Next, we provide recommendations for follow-up strate-gies, with a summary of new evidence, including an overallassessment of the quality of evidence and strength of rec-ommendations. This is followed by a summary of key lim-\nitations of existing evidence, future research opportunities,\nand best practices for research in the ﬁeld. Given the large\namount of data on post-colonoscopy follow-up, we focusprimarily on new publications since the Task Force recom-mendations in 2012. Terms, De ﬁnitions, and Colonoscopy Quality\nAssumptions\nPolyp terms and de ﬁnitions. The polyp surveillance\nliterature varies in terms used for predictors and outcomesand associated de ﬁnitions ( Table 3 ). In this report, normal\ncolonoscopy refers to a colonoscopy where no adenoma,sessile serrated adenoma/polyp or sessile serrated polyp(SSP), hyperplastic polyp (HP) /C2110 mm, traditional\nserrated adenoma (TSA), or CRC was found. We considerindividuals with only HP <10 mm as having had normal\ncolonoscopy. To summarize prior evidence, “low-risk\nadenoma ”refers to having 1 –2 tubular adenomas with\nlow-grade dysplasia, each <10 mm in size. There are 2\nhigher-risk categories commonly described in the pub-lished literature, one based on size and histology(advanced neoplasia), and the other based on number ofadenomas (multiple adenomas). Advanced neoplasia isdeﬁned as an adenoma /C2110 mm, adenoma with tubulovil-\nlous or villous histology, adenoma with high-grade\ndysplasia, or presence of invasive cancer. An adenomawith size /C2110 mm, with tubulovillous or villous histology,\nor with high-grade dysplasia in the absence of invasiveCRC is commonly referred to as an advanced adenoma.As part of the de ﬁnition of villous or tubulovillous histol-\nogy, we do not quantify the proportion of adenoma withvillous features, as this is rarely reported in clinical practice. Also, criteria used to de ﬁne villous histology are often not\nreported in studies and, when reported, are often variable.Patients with 3 or more adenomas (often discussed as“multiple adenomas ”) have been reported previously to\nbe at an increased risk of metachronous advancedneoplasia and, in many studies, considered as belonging\nto a high-risk predictor or outcome group. As such, tosummarize prior evidence in this report, “high-risk ade-\nnoma ”refers to patients with advanced neoplasia or /C213\nadenomas. We recognize variability across studies in theuse of the term high-risk adenoma , with some using this\nterm as a synonym for advanced neoplasia ( Table 3 ). However, when possible, we will make a distinctionbetween advanced neoplasia and high-risk adenomabecause implications of having any advanced neoplasia vsany high-risk adenoma (de ﬁned by advanced neoplasia\nand/or multiple adenomas) on risk for metachronous\nneoplasia may vary. We recognize that evidence on risksfor metachronous neoplasia associated with SSPs and largeHPs is evolving. For example, uncertainty exists as towhether HPs /C2110 mm in size represent lesions associated\nwith increased risk.",

Rate of serrated polyp /C2110 mm (HP,\nSSP, or TSA) at follow-up was substantially higher amongpatients with isolated SSP vs high-risk adenoma at baseline(9.6% vs 1.0%). Among patients with low-risk adenomaplus SSP at baseline, the rate of metachronous high-risk ad-enoma was 18.4% (9 of 49) and metachronousSSP/C2110 mm was 8.2% (4 of 49; Anderson JC, Butterly\nLF, Robinson CM, personal communication, March 14,\n2018). These ﬁndings suggest that patients with isolated\nSSP have low rates of metachronous conventional high-risk adenoma unless they have synchronous conventionaladenomas at baseline. However, patients with SSP at base-line appear to be at increased risk for metachronous largeserrated polyps /C2110 mm (HP, SSP, or TSA), irrespective of\nwhether concurrent conventional adenomas are present.While this is the largest study to date of metachronous\nﬁndings among patients with and without SSPs, a limitation\nis that the risk estimates remain imprecise, owing to therelatively small number of patients with SSP at baselineavailable for evaluation in the various risk strata. In contrastto the aforementioned even smaller studies, however, it isinteresting to note that patients with isolated SSP of anysize as well as HPs /C2110 mm were not found to have\nincreased risk for conventional high-risk adenoma onfollow-up. Taken together, very low quality of evidence exists to\nsupport recommendations for surveillance after removalof 1 –2 SSPs <10 mm. Speci ﬁcally, subgroups describing\noutcomes in those with serrated lesions are small andthere are very limited data on subsequent risk for themost important outcomes (ie, CRC). The largest traditionalcohort study suggests patients with isolated SSPs have lowrisk for traditionally de ﬁned high-risk adenomas, those\nwith synchronous SSPs and conventional adenoma may\nhave high risk for traditionally de ﬁned high-risk adenomas,\nand that all patients with SSPs are at elevated risk for largeserrated polyps on follow-up. Smaller studies at higher riskof bias that used disparate de ﬁnitions of predictors and\noutcomes are variably consistent with these observations.Taking into account the absence of consistent, higher-quality evidence, uncertainty regarding implications of hav-\ning a large serrated polyp at follow-up on CRC risk, and the\nknown challenges of adequate detection\n51and complete\nresection of SSPs,52the Task Force recommends patients\nwith 1 –2 SSPs <10 mm receive repeat colonoscopy in 5 –\n10 years until new evidence can clarify risk for thisgroup. The recommendation for 5- to 10-year follow-upof patients with 1 –2 SSPs <10 mm is more aggressive\nthan the recommendation for 7- to 10-year follow-up of pa-\ntients with 1 –2 isolated conventional adenomas because\nthe evidence base to support longer follow-up for 1 –2 iso-\nlated conventional adenomas is strong, whereas the evi-dence base to support follow-up recommendations forindividuals with 1 –2 SSPs <10 mm is weak. For patients with TSA completely removed at a\nhigh-quality examination, repeat colonoscopy in 3years. ( Weak recommendation, very low quality of\nevidence )\nWe found little new evidence to guide the follow-up\nrecommendation for patients with TSA. A cross-sectionalstudy compared risk for advanced neoplasia and/or /C213 ad-\nenomas at surveillance colonoscopy for patients with priorisolated TSA (n Z186) vs a group of age-/sex-matched pa-\ntients with prior conventional adenoma (n Z372).",

Since complications of treatment with glucocorticoids are dependent on the size of the dose and the duration of treatment, a risk/benefit decision must be made in each individual case as to dose and duration of treatment and as to whether daily or intermittent therapy should be used. Kaposi’s sarcoma has been reported to occur in patients receiving corticosteroid therapy, most often for chronic conditions.",

Use caution when prescribing CLENPIQ for patients at increased risk of arrhythmias (e.g., patients with a history of prolonged QT, uncontrolled arrhythmias, recent myocardial infarction, unstable angina, congestive heart failure, or cardiomyopathy). Consider pre-dose and post-colonoscopy ECGs in patients at increased risk of serious cardiac arrhythmias. 5.5 Syncope Syncope has been reported with CLENPIQ in the postmarketing setting.",

The seizure cases were associated with electrolyte abnormalities (e.g., hyponatremia, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, and hypomagnesemia) and low serum osmolality. The neurologic abnormalities resolved with correction of fluid and electrolyte abnormalities. Use caution when prescribing CLENPIQ for patients with a history of seizures and in patients at risk of seizure, such as patients taking medications that lower the seizure threshold (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants), patients withdrawing from alcohol or benzodiazepines, patients with known or suspected hyponatremia [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] .",

    "content": "PRECAUTIONS General Patients with impaired gag reflex, unconscious or semiconscious patients and patients prone to regurgitation or aspiration should be observed during the administration of GaviLyte- C with flavor pack, especially if it is administered via nasogastric tube. If gastrointestinal obstruction or perforation is suspected appropriate studies should be performed to rule out these conditions before administration of GaviLyte- C with flavor pack. INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS GaviLyte- C with flavor pack produces a watery stool which cleanses the bowel prior to examination. For best results, no solid food should be ingested during the 3 to 4 hour period prior to the initiation of GaviLyte- C with flavor pack administration.",

Rapid drinking of each portion is preferred rather than drinking small amounts continuously. The first bowel movement should occur approximately one hour after the start of GaviLyte- C with flavor pack administration. Administration of GaviLyte- C with flavor pack should be continued until the watery stool is clear and free of solid matter. This normally requires the consumption of approximately 3 to 4 liters (3 to 4 quarts), although more or less may be required in some patients. The unused portion should be discarded.",
