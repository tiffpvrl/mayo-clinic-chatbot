If gastrointestinal obstruction or perforation is suspected, appropriate \ntests should be performed to rule out these conditions before administration of \nMoviPrep®. Phenylketonurics: MoviPrep contains phenylalanine – a maximum of 2.33 mg of \nphenylalanine per treatment. No additional ingredients (e.g., flavorings) should be added to the MoviPrep \nsolution. Since MoviPrep contains sodium ascorbate and ascorbic acid, MoviPrep should \nbe used with caution in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PD) \ndeficiency especially G-6-PD deficiency patients with an active infection, with \na history of hemolysis, or taking concomitant medications known to precipitate \nhemolytic reactions. 5.1 Seizures There have been rare reports of generalized tonic-clonic seizures \nassociated with use of polyethylene glycol colon preparation products in \npatients with no prior history of seizures.  The seizure cases were associated \nwith electrolyte abnormalities (e.g., hyponatremia, hypokalemia).  The \nneurologic abnormalities resolved with correction of fluid and electrolyte \nabnormalities.  Therefore, MoviPrep should be used with caution in patients \nusing concomitant medications that increase the risk of electrolyte \nabnormalities [such as diuretics or angiotensin converting enzyme \n(ACE)-inhibitors] or in patients with known or suspected hyponatremia.  Consider \nperforming baseline and post-colonoscopy laboratory tests (sodium, potassium, \ncalcium, creatinine, and BUN) in these patients."

( 5.2 ) • Seizures : Use caution in patients with a history of seizures and patients at increased risk of seizure, including medications that lower the seizure threshold. ( 5.3 , 7.1 ) • Patients with renal impairment or taking concomitant medications that affect renal function: Use caution, ensure adequate hydration and consider laboratory testing. ( 5.4 , 7.1 , 8.6 ) • Colonic mucosal ulcerations : Consider potential for ulcerations when interpreting colonoscopy findings in patients with known or suspected inflammatory bowel disease. ( 5.5 ) • Suspected GI obstruction or perforation : Rule out the diagnosis before administration. ( 5.6 ) • Patients at risk for aspiration: Observe during administration. ( 5.7 ) • Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G-6-PD) : Use with caution. ( 5.8 ) • Risks in patients with phenylketonuria : Contains phenylalanine ( 5.9 ) • Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis : Inform patients to seek immediate medical care if symptoms occur. ( 5.10 ) 5.1 Serious Fluid and Electrolyte Abnormalities Advise patients to hydrate adequately before, during, and after the use of MoviPrep. If a patient develops significant vomiting or signs of dehydration after taking MoviPrep, consider performing post-colonoscopy lab tests (electrolytes, creatinine, and BUN). Bowel preparations can cause fluid and electrolyte disturbances, which can lead to serious adverse reactions including cardiac arrhythmias, seizures, and renal impairment [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . Correct fluid and electrolyte abnormalities before treatment with MoviPrep. MoviPrep should be used with caution in patients using concomitant medications that increase the risk of electrolyte abnormalities [such as diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)] or in patients with known or suspected hyponatremia. Consider performing pre-dose and post-colonoscopy laboratory tests (sodium, potassium, calcium, creatinine, and BUN) in these patients [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )]. 5.2 Cardiac Arrhythmias There have been rare reports of serious arrhythmias (including atrial fibrillation) associated with the use of ionic osmotic laxative products for bowel preparation. These occur predominantly in patients with underlying cardiac risk factors and electrolyte disturbances. Use caution when prescribing MoviPrep for patients at increased risk of arrhythmias (e.g., patients with a history of prolonged QT, uncontrolled arrhythmias, recent myocardial infarction, unstable angina, congestive heart failure, cardiomyopathy, or electrolyte imbalance). Consider pre-dose and post-colonoscopy ECGs in patients at increased risk of serious cardiac arrhythmias. 5.3 Seizures There have been rare reports of generalized tonic-clonic seizures and/or loss of consciousness associated with use of bowel preparation products in patients with no prior history of seizures. The seizure cases were associated with electrolyte abnormalities (e.g., hyponatremia, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, and hypomagnesemia) and low serum osmolality. The neurologic abnormalities resolved with correction of fluid and electrolyte abnormalities. Use caution when prescribing MoviPrep for patients with a history of seizures and in patients at increased risk of seizure, such as patients taking medications that lower the seizure threshold (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants), patients withdrawing from alcohol or benzodiazepines, or patients with known or suspected hyponatremia [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )]. 5.4 Use in Patients with Renal Impairment Use MoviPrep with caution in patients with renal impairment or patients taking concomitant medications that affect renal function (such as diuretics, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )]. These patients may be at risk for renal injury. Advise these patients of the importance of adequate hydration before, during, and after use of MoviPrep, and consider performing pre-dose and post-colonoscopy laboratory tests (electrolytes, creatinine, and BUN) in these patients [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )]. 5.5 Colonic Mucosal Ulceration, Ischemic Colitis and Ulcerative Colitis Osmotic laxatives may produce colonic mucosal aphthous ulcerations, and there have been reports of more serious cases of ischemic colitis requiring hospitalization. Concurrent use of stimulant laxatives and MoviPrep may increase the risk of mucosal ulceration or ischemic colitis and is not recommended. Consider the potential for mucosal ulcerations resulting from the bowel preparation when interpreting colonoscopy findings in patients with known or suspected inflammatory bowel disease. 5.6 Use in Patients with Significant Gastrointestinal Disease If gastrointestinal obstruction or perforation is suspected, perform appropriate diagnostic studies to rule out these conditions before administering MoviPrep [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . Use with caution in patients with severe ulcerative colitis. 5.7 Aspiration Patients with impaired gag reflex or other swallowing abnormalities are at risk for regurgitation or aspiration of MoviPrep. Observe these patients during the administration of MoviPrep. Use with caution in these patients. Do not combine MoviPrep with starch-based thickeners [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )] . Polyethylene glycol (PEG), a component of MoviPrep, when mixed with starch-thickened liquids reduces the viscosity of the starch-thickened liquid. When a PEG-based product used for another indication was mixed in starch-based pre-thickened liquids used in patients with dysphagia, thinning of the liquid occurred and cases of choking and potential aspiration were reported. 5.8 Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (G6PD) Deficiency Since MoviPrep contains sodium ascorbate and ascorbic acid, MoviPrep should be used with caution in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, especially G6PD deficiency patients with an active infection, with a history of hemolysis, or taking concomitant medications known to precipitate hemolytic reactions. 5.9 Risks in Patients with Phenylketonuria Phenylalanine can be harmful to patients with phenylketonuria (PKU). MoviPrep contains phenylalanine, a component of aspartame. Each MoviPrep treatment contains 131 mg of phenylalanine (after hydrolysis of the aspartame molecule in vivo to aspartic acid and phenylalanine). Before prescribing MoviPrep to a patient with PKU, consider the combined daily amount of phenylalanine from all sources, including MoviPrep. 5.10 Hypersensitivity Reactions MoviPrep contains polyethylene glycol (PEG) and lemon flavoring (containing citral, lime oil, maltodextrin, acacia gum, vitamin E, and other natural flavoring agents) and may cause serious hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis, angioedema, rash, urticaria, and pruritus [see Contraindications (4) , Adverse Reactions (6.2) and Description (11) ] . Inform patients of the signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis and instruct them to seek immediate medical care should signs and symptoms occur. 5.1 Serious Fluid and Electrolyte Abnormalities Advise patients to hydrate adequately before, during, and after the use of MoviPrep. If a patient develops significant vomiting or signs of dehydration after taking MoviPrep, consider performing post-colonoscopy lab tests (electrolytes, creatinine, and BUN). Bowel preparations can cause fluid and electrolyte disturbances, which can lead to serious adverse reactions including cardiac arrhythmias, seizures, and renal impairment [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . Correct fluid and electrolyte abnormalities before treatment with MoviPrep. MoviPrep should be used with caution in patients using concomitant medications that increase the risk of electrolyte abnormalities [such as diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)] or in patients with known or suspected hyponatremia. Consider performing pre-dose and post-colonoscopy laboratory tests (sodium, potassium, calcium, creatinine, and BUN) in these patients [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )]. 5.2 Cardiac Arrhythmias There have been rare reports of serious arrhythmias (including atrial fibrillation) associated with the use of ionic osmotic laxative products for bowel preparation. These occur predominantly in patients with underlying cardiac risk factors and electrolyte disturbances. Use caution when prescribing MoviPrep for patients at increased risk of arrhythmias (e.g., patients with a history of prolonged QT, uncontrolled arrhythmias, recent myocardial infarction, unstable angina, congestive heart failure, cardiomyopathy, or electrolyte imbalance). Consider pre-dose and post-colonoscopy ECGs in patients at increased risk of serious cardiac arrhythmias. 5.3 Seizures There have been rare reports of generalized tonic-clonic seizures and/or loss of consciousness associated with use of bowel preparation products in patients with no prior history of seizures. The seizure cases were associated with electrolyte abnormalities (e.g., hyponatremia, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, and hypomagnesemia) and low serum osmolality. The neurologic abnormalities resolved with correction of fluid and electrolyte abnormalities. Use caution when prescribing MoviPrep for patients with a history of seizures and in patients at increased risk of seizure, such as patients taking medications that lower the seizure threshold (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants), patients withdrawing from alcohol or benzodiazepines, or patients with known or suspected hyponatremia [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )]. 5.4 Use in Patients with Renal Impairment Use MoviPrep with caution in patients with renal impairment or patients taking concomitant medications that affect renal function (such as diuretics, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )].

          "title": "Special Populations",
          "content": "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on MoviPrep in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk for adverse developmental outcomes. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with MoviPrep. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data available on the presence of MoviPrep in human milk, the effects of the drug on the breastfed child, or the effects of the drug on milk production. The lack of clinical data during lactation precludes a clear determination of the risk of MoviPrep to a child during lactation; therefore, the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for MoviPrep and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from MoviPrep or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of MoviPrep in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the 413 patients in clinical trials receiving MoviPrep, 91 (22%) patients were aged 65 or older, while 25 (6%) patients were over 75 years of age. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between geriatric patients and younger patients, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between geriatric patients and younger patients. However, elderly patients are more likely to have decreased hepatic, renal or cardiac function and may be more susceptible to adverse reactions resulting from fluid and electrolyte abnormalities [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . 8.6 Renal Impairment Use MoviPrep with caution in patients with renal impairment or patients taking concomitant medications that may affect renal function [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . These patients may be at risk for renal injury. Advise these patients of the importance of adequate hydration before, during and after the use of MoviPrep, and consider performing baseline and post-colonoscopy laboratory tests (electrolytes, creatinine, and BUN) in these patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]."

          "content": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Risk of fluid and electrolyte abnormalities : Encourage adequate hydration, assess concurrent medications, and consider laboratory assessments prior to and after each use. ( 5.1 , 7.1 ) Cardiac arrhythmias : Consider pre-dose and post-colonoscopy ECGs in patients at increased risk. ( 5.2 ) Seizures : Use caution in patients with a history of seizures and patients at increased risk of seizures, including medications that lower the seizure threshold. ( 5.3 , 7.1 ) Patients with renal impairment or taking concomitant medications that affect renal function : Use caution, ensure adequate hydration and consider laboratory testing. ( 5.4 , 7.1 ) Suspected GI obstruction or perforation : Rule out the diagnosis before administration. ( 4 , 5.6 ) Patients at risk for aspiration : Observe during administration. ( 5.7 ) Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis: Inform patients to seek immediate medical care if symptoms occur. ( 5.8 ) 5.1 Serious Fluid and Serum Chemistry Abnormalities Advise all patients to hydrate adequately before, during, and after the use of SUPREP Bowel Prep Kit. If a patient develops significant vomiting or signs of dehydration after taking SUPREP Bowel Prep Kit, consider performing post-colonoscopy lab tests (electrolytes, creatinine, and BUN). Fluid and electrolyte disturbances can lead to serious adverse events including cardiac arrhythmias, seizures and renal impairment. Correct fluid and electrolyte abnormalities before treatment with SUPREP Bowel Prep Kit. Use SUPREP Bowel Prep Kit with caution in patients with conditions, or who are using medications, that increase the risk for fluid and electrolyte disturbances or may increase the risk of adverse events of seizure, arrhythmias, and renal impairment [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . SUPREP Bowel Prep Kit can cause temporary elevations in uric acid [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Uric acid fluctuations in patients with gout may precipitate an acute flare. The potential for uric acid elevation should be considered before administering SUPREP Bowel Prep Kit to patients with gout or other disorders of uric acid metabolism. 5.2 Cardiac Arrhythmias There have been rare reports of serious arrhythmias associated with the use of ionic osmotic laxative products for bowel preparation. Use caution when prescribing SUPREP Bowel Prep Kit for patients at increased risk of arrhythmias (e.g., patients with a history of prolonged QT, uncontrolled arrhythmias, recent myocardial infarction, unstable angina, congestive heart failure, or cardiomyopathy). Consider pre-dose and post-colonoscopy ECGs in patients at increased risk of serious cardiac arrhythmias. 5.3 Seizures There have been reports of generalized tonic-clonic seizures and/or loss of consciousness associated with use of bowel preparation products in patients with no prior history of seizures. The seizure cases were associated with electrolyte abnormalities (e.g., hyponatremia, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, and hypomagnesemia) and low serum osmolality. The neurologic abnormalities resolved with correction of fluid and electrolyte abnormalities. Use caution when prescribing SUPREP Bowel Prep Kit for patients with a history of seizures and in patients at increased risk of seizure, such as patients taking medications that lower the seizure threshold (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants), patients withdrawing from alcohol or benzodiazepines, or patients with known or suspected hyponatremia [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . 5.4 Use in Patients with Risk of Renal Injury Use SUPREP Bowel Prep Kit with caution in patients with impaired renal function or patients taking concomitant medications that may affect renal function (such as diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . These patients may be at risk for renal injury. Advise these patients of the importance of adequate hydration with SUPREP Bowl Prep Kit and consider performing baseline and post-colonoscopy laboratory tests (electrolytes, creatinine, and BUN) in these patients [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . 5.5 Colonic Mucosal Ulcerations and Ischemic Colitis Osmotic laxative products may produce colonic mucosal aphthous ulcerations, and there have been reports of more serious cases of ischemic colitis requiring hospitalization. Concurrent use of stimulant laxatives and SUPREP Bowel Prep Kit may increase these risks [see Drug Interactions ( 7.3 )] . Consider the potential for mucosal ulcerations resulting from the bowel preparation when interpreting colonoscopy findings in patients with known or suspect inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). 5.6 Use in Patients with Significant Gastrointestinal Disease If gastrointestinal obstruction or perforation is suspected, perform appropriate diagnostic studies to rule out these conditions before administering SUPREP Bowel Prep Kit [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . Use with caution in patients with severe active ulcerative colitis. 5.7 Aspiration Patients with impaired gag reflex or other swallowing abnormalities are at risk for regurgitation or aspiration of SUPREP Bowel Prep Kit solution. Observe these patients during administration of SUPREP Bowel Prep Kit solution. Use with caution in these patients. 5.8 Hypersensitivity Reactions Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, angioedema, dyspnea, rash, pruritus and urticaria have been reported with SUPREP [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . Inform patients of the signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis and instruct them to seek immediate medical care should signs and symptoms occur."

          "title": "Special Populations",
          "content": "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on SUPREP Bowel Prep Kit use in pregnant women to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Animal reproductive studies have not been conducted with sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate, and magnesium sulfate (SUPREP Bowel Prep Kit). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data available data on the presence of SUPREP Bowel Prep Kit in human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for SUPREP Bowel Prep Kit and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from SUPREP Bowel Prep Kit or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of SUPREP Bowel Prep Kit (two 4.5-ounce doses) have been established for cleansing of the colon as a preparation for colonoscopy in pediatric patients 12 years of age and older. Use of SUPREP Bowel Prep Kit in this age group is supported by evidence from an adequate and well-controlled trial of SUPREP Bowel Prep Kit in adults and a single, dose-ranging, controlled trial in 89 pediatric patients 12 years to 16 years of age [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . In the pediatric trial, SUPREP Bowel Prep Kit (two 6-ounce doses) did not demonstrate additional treatment benefit and more patients reported gastrointestinal adverse reactions compared to SUPREP Bowel Prep Kit (two 4.5-ounce doses). Therefore, SUPREP Bowel Prep Kit (two 6-ounce doses) is not recommended for pediatric patients 12 years of age and older [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] . The safety profile of SUPREP Bowel Prep Kit (two 4.5-ounce doses) in this pediatric population was similar to that seen in adults [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . The safety and effectiveness of SUPREP Bowel Prep Kit in pediatric patients less than 12 years of age have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the 375 patients who received SUPREP Bowel Prep Kit in clinical trials, 94 (25%) were 65 years of age or older, and 25 (7%) were 75 years of age or older. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness of SUPREP Bowel Prep Kit, administered as the recommended split-dose (2-day) regimen, were observed between geriatric patients and younger patients. Geriatric patients reported more vomiting when SUPREP Bowel Prep Kit was given as a one-day preparation (not a recommended regimen). Elderly patients are more likely to have decreased hepatic, renal or cardiac function and may be more susceptible to adverse reactions resulting from fluid and electrolyte abnormalities [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . 8.6 Renal Impairment Use SUPREP Bowel Prep Kit with caution in patients with renal impairment or patients taking concomitant medications that may affect renal function. These patients may be at risk for renal injury. Advise these patients of the importance of adequate hydration before, during and after use of SUPREP Bowel Prep Kit and consider performing baseline and post-colonoscopy laboratory tests (electrolytes, creatinine, and BUN) in these patients [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] ."

Prepare the solution according to the instructions on the bottle. It is more palatable if chilled. For best results, no solid food should be consumed during the 3 to 4 hour period before drinking the solution, but in no case should solid foods be eaten within 2 hours of taking GoLYTELY for Oral Solution. Drink 240 mL (8 oz.) every 10 minutes. Rapid drinking of each portion is better than drinking small amounts continuously. The first bowel movement should occur approximately one hour after the start of GoLYTELY for Oral Solution administration. You may experience some abdominal bloating and distention before the bowels start to move. If severe discomfort or distention occur, stop drinking temporarily or drink each portion at longer intervals until these symptoms disappear. Continue drinking until the watery stool is clear and free of solid matter. This usually requires at least 3 liters and it is best to drink all of the solution. Any unused portion should be discarded."

Ideally, the patient should fast for approximately three or four hours prior to GoLYTELY for Oral Solution administration, but in no case should solid food be given for at least two hours before the solution is given. GoLYTELY for Oral Solution is usually administered orally, but may be given via nasogastric tube to patients who are unwilling or unable to drink the solution. Oral administration is at a rate of 240 mL (8 oz.) every 10 minutes, until 4 liters are consumed or the rectal effluent is clear. Rapid drinking of each portion is preferred to drinking small amounts continuously. Nasogastric tube administration is at the rate of 20-30 mL per minute (1.2-1.8 liters per hour). The first bowel movement should occur approximately one hour after the start of GoLYTELY for Oral Solution administration. Various regimens have been used. One method is to schedule patients for examination in midmorning or later, allowing the patients three hours for drinking and an additional one hour period for complete bowel evacuation. Another method is to administer GoLYTELY for Oral Solution on the evening before the examination, particularly if the patient is to have a barium enema."

( 5.1 , 5.2 , 7.1 ) Cardiac arrhythmias : Consider pre-dose and post-colonoscopy ECGs in patients at increased risk of serious cardiac arrhythmias. ( 5.2 ) Seizures : Use caution in patients with a history of seizures and patients at increased risk of seizure, including medications that lower the seizure threshold. ( 5.3 , 7.1 ) Patients with renal impairment or taking concomitant medications that affect renal function : Use caution, ensure adequate hydration and consider testing. ( 5.4 , 7.1 , 8.6 ) Mucosal ulcerations : Consider potential for mucosal ulcerations when interpreting colonoscopy findings in patients with known or suspected inflammatory bowel disease. ( 5.5 , 7.3 ) Patients at risk for aspiration : Observe during administration. ( 5.7 ) Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis : Inform patients to seek immediate medical care if symptoms occur. ( 5.8 ) 5.1 Serious Fluid and Serum Chemistry Abnormalities Advise patients to hydrate adequately before, during, and after the use of GoLYTELY. Use caution in patients with congestive heart failure when replacing fluids. If a patient develops significant vomiting or signs of dehydration including signs of orthostatic hypotension after taking GoLYTELY, consider performing post-colonoscopy lab tests (electrolytes, creatinine, and BUN) and treat accordingly. Fluid and electrolyte disturbances can lead to serious adverse events including cardiac arrhythmias, seizures and renal impairment. Correct fluid and electrolyte abnormalities before treatment with GoLYTELY. In addition, use caution when prescribing GoLYTELY for patients who have conditions, or who are using medications, that increase the risk for fluid and electrolyte disturbances or may increase the risk of adverse events of seizure, arrhythmias, and renal impairment [ see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ) ]. 5.2 Cardiac Arrythmias There have been rare reports of serious arrhythmias associated with the use of ionic osmotic laxative products for bowel preparation. Use caution when prescribing GoLYTELY for patients at increased risk of arrhythmias (e.g., patients with a history of prolonged QT, uncontrolled arrhythmias, recent myocardial infarction, unstable angina, congestive heart failure, or cardiomyopathy). Consider pre-dose and post-colonoscopy ECGs in patients at increased risk of serious cardiac arrhythmias. 5.3 Seizures There have been reports of generalized tonic-clonic seizures and/or loss of consciousness associated with use of bowel preparation products in patients with no prior history of seizures. The seizure cases were associated with electrolyte abnormalities (e.g., hyponatremia, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, and hypomagnesemia) and low serum osmolality. The neurologic abnormalities resolved with correction of fluid and electrolyte abnormalities. Use caution when prescribing GoLYTELY for patients with a history of seizures and in patients at increased risk of seizure, such as patients taking medications that lower the seizure threshold (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants), patients withdrawing from alcohol or benzodiazepines, or patients with known or suspected hyponatremia [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . 5.4 Renal Impairment Use caution when prescribing GoLYTELY for patients with impaired renal function or patients taking concomitant medications that may affect renal function (such as diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . Advise these patients of the importance of adequate hydration and consider performing baseline and post-colonoscopy laboratory tests (electrolytes, creatinine, and BUN) in these patients [see Use is Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . 5.5 Colonic Mucosal Ulcerations and Ischemic Colitis Administration of osmotic laxative products may produce colonic mucosal aphthous ulcerations, and there have been reports of more serious cases of ischemic colitis requiring hospitalization. Concurrent use of stimulant laxatives and GoLYTELY may increase this risk [see Drug Interactions ( 7.3 )] . Consider the potential for mucosal ulcerations resulting from the bowel preparation when interpreting colonoscopy findings in patients with known or suspect inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). 5.6 Use in Patients with Significant Gastrointestinal Disease If gastrointestinal obstruction or perforation is suspected, perform appropriate diagnostic studies to rule out these conditions before administering GoLYTELY [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . Use with caution in patients with severe active ulcerative colitis. 5.7 Aspiration Use with caution in patients with impaired gag reflex, unconscious, or semiconscious patients, and patients prone to regurgitation or aspiration. Observe these patients during administration of GoLYTELY, especially if it is administered via nasogastric tube.Use with caution in patients with impaired gag reflex, unconscious, or semiconscious patients, and patients prone to regurgitation or aspiration. Observe these patients during administration of GoLYTELY, especially if it is administered via nasogastric tube. Do not combine GoLYTELY with starch-based thickeners [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )] . Polyethylene glycol (PEG), a component of GoLYTELY, when mixed with starch- thickened liquids reduces the viscosity of the starch-thickened liquid. When a PEG-based product used for another indication was mixed in starch-based pre-thickened liquids used in patients with dysphagia, thinning of the liquid occurred and cases of choking and potential aspiration were reported. 5.8 Hypersensitivity Reactions GoLYTELY contains PEG and may cause serious hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis, angioedema, rash, urticaria, and pruritus [see Adverse Reactions ( 6 )] . Inform patients of the signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis and instruct them to seek immediate medical care should signs and symptoms occur."

Stop drinking PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution temporarily or drink each portion at longer intervals if severe bloating, abdominal discomfort or distention occurs, until these symptoms resolve. 2.3 One-Day Evening Only Dosing Regimen (Alternative Method) The One-Day Evening Only regimen is the alternative dosing method for patients for whom the Split-Dosing regimen is inappropriate. Instruct adult patients that on the day before the clinical procedure, they can consume breakfast, followed by a light lunch (no solid foods), and clear soup and/or plain yogurt for dinner, which must be completed at least 1 hour prior to the start of the first PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution dose. Instruct adult patients to take two separate doses in conjunction with fluids as follows: Dose 1 – At least 3 ½ hours before bedtime the evening before the colonoscopy : Empty the contents of 1 Pouch A, 1 Pouch B and 1 Lemon Flavor pack into the mixing container that comes with PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution. Add lukewarm water to the Fill Line on the mixing container (32 fluid ounces). Do not add other ingredients to the PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution- solution. Thoroughly mix with a spoon or shake with lid on securely until the contents of Pouch A, Pouch B and Lemon Flavor pack are completely dissolved. Drink 8 ounces of the solution every 15 minutes. This should take about 1 hour. Be sure to drink all the solution. Dose 2 – At least 1 ½ hours after starting Dose 1 on the evening before the colonoscopy : Empty the contents of 1 Pouch A, 1 Pouch B and 1 Lemon Flavor pack into the mixing container that comes with PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution. Add lukewarm water to the Fill Line on the mixing container (32 fluid ounces). Do not add other ingredients to the PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution- solution. Thoroughly mix with a spoon or shake with lid on securely until the contents of Pouch A, Pouch B and Lemon Flavor pack are completely dissolved. Drink 8 ounces of the solution every 15 minutes. This should take about 1 hour. Be sure to drink all of the solution. Refill the mixing container to the Fill Line (32 fluid ounces) with a clear liquid and drink all this liquid before going to bed. Consume additional water or clear liquids up to 2 hours before the colonoscopy or as prescribed by your healthcare provider. Then stop drinking liquids until after the colonoscopy. Stop drinking PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution temporarily or drink each portion at longer intervals if severe bloating, abdominal discomfort or distention occurs, until these symptoms resolve."

          "content": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Risk of fluid and electrolyte abnormalities : Encourage adequate hydration, assess concurrent medications, and consider laboratory assessments prior to and after use. ( 5.1 , 7.1 ) Cardiac arrhythmias : Consider pre-dose and post-colonoscopy ECGs in patients at increased risk. (5.2) Seizures: Use caution in patients with a history of seizures and patients at increased risk of seizure, including medications that lower the seizure threshold. ( 5.3 , 7.1 ) Patients with renal impairment or taking concomitant medications that affect renal function : Use caution, ensure adequate hydration and consider laboratory testing. ( 5.4 , 7.1 , 8.6 ) Colonic mucosal ulcerations : Consider potential for ulcerations when interpreting colonoscopy findings in patients with known or suspected inflammatory bowel disease. ( 5.5 ) Suspected GI obstruction or perforation : Rule out the diagnosis before administration. ( 5.6 ) Patients at risk for aspiration : Observe during administration. ( 5.7 ) Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G-6-PD) : Use with caution. ( 5.8 ) Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis : Inform patients to seek immediate medical care if symptoms occur. ( 5.10 ) 5.1 Serious Fluid and Electrolyte Abnormalities Advise patients to hydrate adequately before, during, and after the use of PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution. If a patient develops significant vomiting or signs of dehydration after taking PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution, consider performing post-colonoscopy lab tests (electrolytes, creatinine, and BUN). Bowel preparations can cause fluid and electrolyte disturbances, which can lead to serious adverse reactions including cardiac arrhythmias, seizures, and renal impairment [ see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . Correct fluid and electrolyte abnormalities before treatment with PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution. PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution should be used with caution in patients using concomitant medications that increase the risk of electrolyte abnormalities [such as diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)] or in patients with known or suspected hyponatremia. Consider performing pre-dose and post-colonoscopy laboratory tests (sodium, potassium, calcium, creatinine, and BUN) in these patients [ see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. 5.2 Cardiac Arrhythmias There have been rare reports of serious arrhythmias (including atrial fibrillation) associated with the use of ionic osmotic laxative products for bowel preparation. These occur predominantly in patients with underlying cardiac risk factors and electrolyte disturbances. Use caution when prescribing PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution for patients at increased risk of arrhythmias (e.g., patients with a history of prolonged QT, uncontrolled arrhythmias, recent myocardial infarction, unstable angina, congestive heart failure, cardiomyopathy, or electrolyte imbalance). Consider pre-dose and post-colonoscopy ECGs in patients at increased risk of serious cardiac arrhythmias. 5.3 Seizures There have been rare reports of generalized tonic-clonic seizures and/or loss of consciousness associated with use of bowel preparation products in patients with no prior history of seizures. The seizure cases were associated with electrolyte abnormalities (e.g., hyponatremia, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, and hypomagnesemia) and low serum osmolality. The neurologic abnormalities resolved with correction of fluid and electrolyte abnormalities. Use caution when prescribing PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution for patients with a history of seizures and in patients at increased risk of seizure, such as patients taking medications that lower the seizure threshold (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants), patients withdrawing from alcohol or benzodiazepines, or patients with known or suspected hyponatremia [ see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . 5.4 Use in Patients with Renal Impairment Use PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution with caution in patients with renal impairment or patients taking concomitant medications that affect renal function (such as diuretics, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) [ see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . These patients may be at risk for renal injury. Advise these patients of the importance of adequate hydration before, during, and after use of PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution, and consider performing pre-dose and post-colonoscopy laboratory tests (electrolytes, creatinine, and BUN) in these patients [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . 5.5 Colonic Mucosal Ulceration, Ischemic Colitis and Ulcerative Colitis Osmotic laxatives may produce colonic mucosal aphthous ulcerations, and there have been reports of more serious cases of ischemic colitis requiring hospitalization. Concurrent use of stimulant laxatives and PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution may increase the risk of mucosal ulceration or ischemic colitis and is not recommended. Consider the potential for mucosal ulcerations resulting from the bowel preparation when interpreting colonoscopy findings in patients with known or suspected inflammatory bowel disease. 5.6 Use in Patients with Significant Gastrointestinal Disease If gastrointestinal obstruction or perforation is suspected, perform appropriate diagnostic studies to rule out these conditions before administering PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution [ see Contraindications (4) ] . Use with caution in patients with severe ulcerative colitis. 5.7 Aspiration Patients with impaired gag reflex or other swallowing abnormalities are at risk for regurgitation or aspiration of PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution. Observe these patients during the administration of PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution. Use with caution in these patients. Do not combine PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution with starch-based thickeners [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )] . Polyethylene glycol (PEG), a component of PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution, when mixed with starch-thickened liquids reduces the viscosity of the starch-thickened liquid. When a PEG-based product used for another indication was mixed in starch-based pre-thickened liquids used in patients with dysphagia, thinning of the liquid occurred and cases of choking and potential aspiration were reported. 5.8 Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (G6PD) Deficiency Since PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution contains sodium ascorbate and ascorbic acid, PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution should be used with caution in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, especially G6PD deficiency patients with an active infection, with a history of hemolysis, or taking concomitant medications known to precipitate hemolytic reactions. 5.10 Hypersensitivity Reactions PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution contains polyethylene glycol (PEG) and lemon flavoring (containing Natural Lemon Flavor, Maltodextrin and Saccharin Sodium) and may cause serious hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis, angioedema, rash, urticaria, and pruritus [see Contraindications ( 4 ), Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ) and Description ( 11 )] . Inform patients of the signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis, and instruct them to seek immediate medical care should signs and symptoms occur."

The safety of PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution as a Two-Day Split-Dosing and One-Day Evening Only Dosing Regimen was evaluated in two randomized, active-controlled, multicenter, investigator-blinded clinical trials in adult patients scheduled to have an elective colonoscopy [see Clinical Studies (14)] . The safety analysis for Study 1 included 359 adult patients ranging in age from 18 to 88 years (mean age 59), with 52% female and 48% male patients. The safety analysis for Study 2 included 340 adult patients ranging in age from 21 to 76 years (mean age 53), with 53% male and 47% female patients. Tables 1 and 2 display adverse reactions reported in at least 2% and 5% of patients in either treatment group in Study 1 and Study 2, respectively. Since diarrhea was considered as a part of the efficacy assessment, it was not defined as an adverse reaction in these trials.

          "content": "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk for adverse developmental outcomes. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data available on the presence of PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution in human milk, the effects of the drug on the breastfed child, or the effects of the drug on milk production. The lack of clinical data during lactation precludes a clear determination of the risk of PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution to a child during lactation; therefore, the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the 413 patients in clinical trials receiving PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution, 91 (22%) patients were aged 65 or older, while 25 (6%) patients were over 75 years of age. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between geriatric patients and younger patients, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between geriatric patients and younger patients. However, elderly patients are more likely to have decreased hepatic, renal or cardiac function and may be more susceptible to adverse reactions resulting from fluid and electrolyte abnormalities [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . 8.6 Renal Impairment Use PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution with caution in patients with renal impairment or patients taking concomitant medications that may affect renal function [see Drug Interactions (7.1)] . These patients may be at risk for renal injury. Advise these patients of the importance of adequate hydration before, during and after the use of PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution, and consider performing baseline and post-colonoscopy laboratory tests (electrolytes, creatinine, and BUN) in these patients [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] ."

( 4 , 5.3 , 7.1 ) Syncope : Resulted in serious outcomes including falls, head injuries, and fractures; encourage adequate hydration. ( 5.5 ) Mucosal ulcerations : Consider potential for mucosal ulcerations when interpreting colonoscopy findings in patients with known or suspected inflammatory bowel disease. ( 5.6 ) Suspected GI obstruction or perforation : Rule out diagnosis before administration. ( 4 , 5.7 ) Patients at risk for aspiration : Observe during administration. ( 5.8 ) 5.1 Serious Fluid and Electrolyte Abnormalities Advise patients to hydrate adequately before, during, and after the use of CLENPIQ. Use caution in patients with congestive heart failure when replacing fluids. If a patient develops significant vomiting or signs of dehydration including signs of orthostatic hypotension after taking CLENPIQ, consider performing post-colonoscopy lab tests (electrolytes, creatinine, and BUN) and treat accordingly. Approximately 20% of patients in both arms (sodium picosulfate, magnesium oxide, and anhydrous citric acid, or 2 L of PEG + E plus two × 5-mg bisacodyl tablets) of clinical trials of another oral sodium picosulfate, magnesium oxide, and anhydrous citric acid product had orthostatic changes in blood pressure and/or heart rate on the day of colonoscopy and up to seven days post colonoscopy. In a single study of patients 9 to 16 years of age, approximately 20% of patients who received another oral product of sodium picosulfate, magnesium oxide, and anhydrous citric acid had orthostatic changes (changes in blood pressure and/or heart rate) compared with approximately 7% of those who received the comparator (PEG) [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . These changes occurred up to five days post colonoscopy. Fluid and electrolyte disturbances can lead to serious adverse reactions including cardiac arrhythmias, seizures, renal impairment, and syncope [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] . Correct fluid and electrolyte abnormalities before treatment with CLENPIQ. Advise patients to consume a variety of clear liquids (e.g., balanced electrolyte solution), and not only water after each dose of CLENPIQ. In addition, use caution when prescribing CLENPIQ for patients who have conditions or who are using medications that increase the risk for fluid and electrolyte disturbances or that may increase the risk of seizure, arrhythmia, and renal impairment [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . 5.2 Seizures There have been reports of generalized tonic-clonic seizures and/or loss of consciousness with the use of bowel preparation products in patients with no prior history of seizures. The seizure cases were associated with electrolyte abnormalities (e.g., hyponatremia, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, and hypomagnesemia) and low serum osmolality. The neurologic abnormalities resolved with correction of fluid and electrolyte abnormalities. Use caution when prescribing CLENPIQ for patients with a history of seizures and in patients at risk of seizure, such as patients taking medications that lower the seizure threshold (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants), patients withdrawing from alcohol or benzodiazepines, patients with known or suspected hyponatremia [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . 5.3 Use in Patients with Renal Impairment CLENPIQ is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min), accumulation of magnesium in plasma may occur. Use caution when prescribing CLENPIQ for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment or patients taking concomitant medications that may affect renal function (such as diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . These patients may be at increased risk for renal injury. Advise these patients of the importance of adequate hydration before, during, and after the use of CLENPIQ. Consider performing baseline and post-colonoscopy laboratory tests (electrolytes, creatinine, and BUN) in these patients. 5.4 Cardiac Arrhythmias There have been rare reports of serious arrhythmias associated with the use of ionic osmotic laxative products for bowel preparation. Use caution when prescribing CLENPIQ for patients at increased risk of arrhythmias (e.g., patients with a history of prolonged QT, uncontrolled arrhythmias, recent myocardial infarction, unstable angina, congestive heart failure, or cardiomyopathy). Consider pre-dose and post-colonoscopy ECGs in patients at increased risk of serious cardiac arrhythmias. 5.5 Syncope Syncope has been reported with CLENPIQ in the postmarketing setting. Some cases were serious events that included falls with associated head injuries or fractures requiring hospitalization. In some cases, electrolyte abnormalities were also present (e.g., hyponatremia and hypokalemia). Cases have been reported after one or two CLENPIQ doses and many of these cases occurred within 12 hours of dosing. Patients should be aware of the risk of syncope during treatment and adequately hydrate before, during, and after the use of CLENPIQ. Advise patients to consume a variety of clear liquids (e.g., balanced electrolyte solution), not only water after each dose of CLENPIQ and to get up gradually from a lying or sitting position [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . 5.6 Colonic Mucosal Ulceration, Ischemic Colitis, and Ulcerative Colitis Osmotic laxatives may produce colonic mucosal aphthous ulcerations and there have been reports of more serious cases of ischemic colitis requiring hospitalization. Concurrent use of additional stimulant laxatives with CLENPIQ may increase this risk. Consider the potential for mucosal ulcerations when interpreting colonoscopy findings in patients with known or suspected inflammatory bowel disease [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . 5.7 Use in Patients with Significant Gastrointestinal Disease If gastrointestinal obstruction or perforation is suspected, perform appropriate diagnostic studies to rule out these conditions before administering CLENPIQ [see Contraindications (4) ] . Use with caution in patients with severe active ulcerative colitis. 5.8 Aspiration Patients with impaired gag reflex are at risk for regurgitation or aspiration during the administration of CLENPIQ. Observe these patients during the administration of CLENPIQ."

Adults Clinical Study of CLENPIQ - Study 1 Table 1 displays the most common adverse reactions in a randomized, multicenter, assessor-blinded, non-inferiority trial of CLENPIQ for colon cleansing in adults (Study 1). CLENPIQ was compared to another oral sodium picosulfate, magnesium oxide, and anhydrous citric acid product, both administered according to the Split-Dose dosage regimen [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . Table 1: Common Adverse Reactions Observed in at Least 2% of Patients Undergoing Colon Cleansing in Study 1 Adverse Reaction Split-Dose Regimen CLENPIQ (N=448) % Sodium picosulfate, magnesium oxide, and anhydrous citric acid Powder for reconstitution (N=453) % Nausea 3 3 Headache 3 3 Hypermagnesemia Magnesium levels returned to normal within one week after colonoscopy in all patients in the CLENPIQ group. 2 5 Abdominal pain Abdominal pain included reports of abdominal pain, abdominal pain upper, and abdominal pain lower. 2 2 Dehydration or dizziness 2 2 Clinical Study of Another Sodium Picosulfate, Magnesium Oxide and Anhydrous Citric Acid Product - Study 2 In a randomized, multicenter, investigator-blinded, active-controlled clinical trial for colon cleansing in adults, another oral sodium picosulfate, magnesium oxide, and anhydrous citric acid product was compared with a regimen of two liters (2 L) of polyethylene glycol plus electrolytes solution (PEG + E) and two 5-mg bisacodyl tablets (Study 2). In this study the protocol specified that abdominal bloating, distention, pain/cramping, and watery diarrhea, which are known to occur in response to bowel preparation, were documented as adverse events only if they required medical intervention (such as a change in study drug or led to discontinuation, therapeutic or diagnostic procedures, met the criteria for serious adverse event) or showed clinically significant worsening during the study that was not in the frame of the usual clinical course, as determined by the investigator. The most common adverse reactions in Study 2 are shown in Table 2. Table 2: Common Adverse Reactions abdominal bloating, distention, pain/cramping, and watery diarrhea not requiring an intervention were not collected Observed in at Least 1% of Patients Undergoing Colon Cleansing in Study 2 Adverse Reaction Split-Dose Regimen Sodium picosulfate, magnesium oxide, and anhydrous citric acid (N=305) % 2 L PEG + E 2 L PEG + E = two liters polyethylene glycol plus electrolytes solution with 2 × 5-mg bisacodyl tablets (N=298) % Nausea 3 4 Headache 2 2 Vomiting 1 3 Electrolyte Abnormalities In Study 1, rates of abnormal electrolyte shifts were generally similar between CLENPIQ and another sodium picosulfate, magnesium oxide, and anhydrous citric acid product (Table 3). In general, these shifts were transient and not clinically significant. In Study 2, sodium picosulfate, magnesium oxide, and anhydrous citric acid was in general associated with numerically higher rates of abnormal electrolyte shifts on the day of colonoscopy compared to the control regimen (Table 3). These shifts were transient in nature and numerically similar between treatment arms at the Day 28 visit.

Electrolytes abnormalities were observed in pediatric patients similar to those seen in adults. Three patients had abnormally low glucose levels (40 to 47 mg/dL). Two patients received sodium picosulfate, magnesium oxide, and anhydrous citric acid and one received the comparator (PEG). The abnormal values occurred at the colonoscopy visit for one patient (sodium picosulfate, magnesium oxide, and anhydrous citric acid) and at the 5-day follow up visit for the other two patients (sodium picosulfate, magnesium oxide, and anhydrous citric acid and PEG). All three patients were asymptomatic. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of oral sodium picosulfate, magnesium oxide, and anhydrous citric acid products. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hypersensitivity : rash, urticaria, and purpura Gastrointestinal: abdominal pain, diarrhea, fecal incontinence, proctalgia, vomiting, reversible aphthoid ileal ulcers, and ischemic colitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Neurologic: generalized tonic-clonic seizures with and without hyponatremia in epileptic patients, and syncope [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2 , 5.5) ] ."

        "special_populations": {
          "title": "Special Populations",
          "content": "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no data with CLENPIQ use in pregnant women to determine a drug-associated risk of adverse developmental outcomes. In animal reproduction studies, no adverse developmental effects were observed in pregnant rats when sodium picosulfate, magnesium oxide, and anhydrous citric acid were administered orally at doses 1.2 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area during organogenesis. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Reproduction studies with sodium picosulfate, magnesium oxide, and anhydrous citric acid have been performed in pregnant rats following oral administration of up to 2000 mg/kg twice daily (about 1.2 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area) during the period of organogenesis. There was no evidence of harm to the fetus due to sodium picosulfate, magnesium oxide, and anhydrous citric acid. The reproduction study in rabbits was not adequate, as treatment-related mortalities were observed at all doses. A pre and postnatal development study with sodium picosulfate, magnesium oxide, and anhydrous citric acid in rats showed no evidence of any adverse effect on pre and postnatal development at oral doses up to 2000 mg/kg twice daily (about 1.2 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area). Published reproduction studies with sodium picosulfate in pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis did not show evidence of harm to the fetus at doses up to 100 mg/kg (approximately 49 and 98 times, respectively, the recommended human dose of 10 mg sodium picosulfate based on body surface area). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of magnesium oxide or anhydrous citric acid in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Published data on lactating women indicate that the active metabolite of sodium picosulfate, bis-( p -hydroxyphenyl)-pyridyl-2-methane (BHPM) remained below the limit of detection (1 ng/mL) in breast milk after both single and multiple doses of 10 mg/day. There are no data on the effects of sodium picosulfate on the breastfed infant or on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for CLENPIQ and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from CLENPIQ or the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of CLENPIQ have been established for cleansing of the colon as a preparation for colonoscopy in pediatric patients 9 years of age and older. Use of CLENPIQ in this age group is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled trials in adults and a single, dose-ranging, controlled trial in 78 pediatric patients 9 to 16 years of age all of which evaluated another oral product of sodium picosulfate, magnesium oxide, and anhydrous citric acid [see Clinical Studies (14) ]. The safety profile in this pediatric population was similar to that seen in adults [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Monitor for possible hypoglycemia in pediatric patients, as CLENPIQ has no caloric substrate. The safety and effectiveness of CLENPIQ in pediatric patients less than 9 years of age have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the 448 adult patients in Study 1 who received CLENPIQ, 124 (28%) patients were 65 years of age or older. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between geriatric patients and younger patients, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between elderly and younger patients. Elderly patients are more likely to have decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and may be more susceptible to adverse reactions resulting from fluid and electrolyte abnormalities [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. 8.6 Renal Impairment CLENPIQ is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min), as accumulation of magnesium in plasma may occur [see Contraindications (4) ] . Patients with less severe renal impairment or patients taking concomitant medications that may affect renal function may be at increased risk for renal injury [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Advise these patients of the importance of adequate hydration before, during, and after the use of CLENPIQ [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] . Consider performing baseline and post-colonoscopy laboratory tests (electrolytes, creatinine, and BUN) in these patients."

          "content": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Risk of fluid and electrolyte abnormalities, arrhythmia, seizures, and renal impairment : Encourage adequate hydration, assess concurrent medications, and consider laboratory assessments prior to and after use. ( 5.1 , 5.2 , 5.3 , 5.4 , 7.1 ) Use in patients with renal impairment or taking concomitant medications that affect renal function : Use caution, ensure adequate hydration, and consider testing. ( 4 , 5.3 , 7.1 ) Syncope : Resulted in serious outcomes including falls, head injuries, and fractures; encourage adequate hydration. ( 5.5 ) Mucosal ulcerations : Consider potential for mucosal ulcerations when interpreting colonoscopy findings in patients with known or suspected inflammatory bowel disease. ( 5.6 ) Suspected GI obstruction or perforation : Rule out diagnosis before administration. ( 4 , 5.7 ) Patients at risk for aspiration : Observe during administration. ( 5.8 ) 5.1 Serious Fluid and Electrolyte Abnormalities Advise patients to hydrate adequately before, during, and after the use of CLENPIQ. Use caution in patients with congestive heart failure when replacing fluids. If a patient develops significant vomiting or signs of dehydration including signs of orthostatic hypotension after taking CLENPIQ, consider performing post-colonoscopy lab tests (electrolytes, creatinine, and BUN) and treat accordingly. Approximately 20% of patients in both arms (sodium picosulfate, magnesium oxide, and anhydrous citric acid, or 2 L of PEG + E plus two × 5-mg bisacodyl tablets) of clinical trials of another oral sodium picosulfate, magnesium oxide, and anhydrous citric acid product had orthostatic changes in blood pressure and/or heart rate on the day of colonoscopy and up to seven days post colonoscopy. In a single study of patients 9 to 16 years of age, approximately 20% of patients who received another oral product of sodium picosulfate, magnesium oxide, and anhydrous citric acid had orthostatic changes (changes in blood pressure and/or heart rate) compared with approximately 7% of those who received the comparator (PEG) [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . These changes occurred up to five days post colonoscopy. Fluid and electrolyte disturbances can lead to serious adverse reactions including cardiac arrhythmias, seizures, renal impairment, and syncope [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] . Correct fluid and electrolyte abnormalities before treatment with CLENPIQ. Advise patients to consume a variety of clear liquids (e.g., balanced electrolyte solution), and not only water after each dose of CLENPIQ. In addition, use caution when prescribing CLENPIQ for patients who have conditions or who are using medications that increase the risk for fluid and electrolyte disturbances or that may increase the risk of seizure, arrhythmia, and renal impairment [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . 5.2 Seizures There have been reports of generalized tonic-clonic seizures and/or loss of consciousness with the use of bowel preparation products in patients with no prior history of seizures. The seizure cases were associated with electrolyte abnormalities (e.g., hyponatremia, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, and hypomagnesemia) and low serum osmolality. The neurologic abnormalities resolved with correction of fluid and electrolyte abnormalities. Use caution when prescribing CLENPIQ for patients with a history of seizures and in patients at risk of seizure, such as patients taking medications that lower the seizure threshold (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants), patients withdrawing from alcohol or benzodiazepines, patients with known or suspected hyponatremia [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . 5.3 Use in Patients with Renal Impairment CLENPIQ is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min), accumulation of magnesium in plasma may occur. Use caution when prescribing CLENPIQ for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment or patients taking concomitant medications that may affect renal function (such as diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . These patients may be at increased risk for renal injury. Advise these patients of the importance of adequate hydration before, during, and after the use of CLENPIQ. Consider performing baseline and post-colonoscopy laboratory tests (electrolytes, creatinine, and BUN) in these patients. 5.4 Cardiac Arrhythmias There have been rare reports of serious arrhythmias associated with the use of ionic osmotic laxative products for bowel preparation. Use caution when prescribing CLENPIQ for patients at increased risk of arrhythmias (e.g., patients with a history of prolonged QT, uncontrolled arrhythmias, recent myocardial infarction, unstable angina, congestive heart failure, or cardiomyopathy). Consider pre-dose and post-colonoscopy ECGs in patients at increased risk of serious cardiac arrhythmias. 5.5 Syncope Syncope has been reported with CLENPIQ in the postmarketing setting. Some cases were serious events that included falls with associated head injuries or fractures requiring hospitalization. In some cases, electrolyte abnormalities were also present (e.g., hyponatremia and hypokalemia). Cases have been reported after one or two CLENPIQ doses and many of these cases occurred within 12 hours of dosing. Patients should be aware of the risk of syncope during treatment and adequately hydrate before, during, and after the use of CLENPIQ. Advise patients to consume a variety of clear liquids (e.g., balanced electrolyte solution), not only water after each dose of CLENPIQ and to get up gradually from a lying or sitting position [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . 5.6 Colonic Mucosal Ulceration, Ischemic Colitis, and Ulcerative Colitis Osmotic laxatives may produce colonic mucosal aphthous ulcerations and there have been reports of more serious cases of ischemic colitis requiring hospitalization. Concurrent use of additional stimulant laxatives with CLENPIQ may increase this risk. Consider the potential for mucosal ulcerations when interpreting colonoscopy findings in patients with known or suspected inflammatory bowel disease [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . 5.7 Use in Patients with Significant Gastrointestinal Disease If gastrointestinal obstruction or perforation is suspected, perform appropriate diagnostic studies to rule out these conditions before administering CLENPIQ [see Contraindications (4) ] . Use with caution in patients with severe active ulcerative colitis. 5.8 Aspiration Patients with impaired gag reflex are at risk for regurgitation or aspiration during the administration of CLENPIQ. Observe these patients during the administration of CLENPIQ."

Adults Clinical Study of CLENPIQ - Study 1 Table 1 displays the most common adverse reactions in a randomized, multicenter, assessor-blinded, non-inferiority trial of CLENPIQ for colon cleansing in adults (Study 1). CLENPIQ was compared to another oral sodium picosulfate, magnesium oxide, and anhydrous citric acid product, both administered according to the Split-Dose dosage regimen [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . Table 1: Common Adverse Reactions Observed in at Least 2% of Patients Undergoing Colon Cleansing in Study 1 Adverse Reaction Split-Dose Regimen CLENPIQ (N=448) % Sodium picosulfate, magnesium oxide, and anhydrous citric acid Powder for reconstitution (N=453) % Nausea 3 3 Headache 3 3 Hypermagnesemia Magnesium levels returned to normal within one week after colonoscopy in all patients in the CLENPIQ group. 2 5 Abdominal pain Abdominal pain included reports of abdominal pain, abdominal pain upper, and abdominal pain lower. 2 2 Dehydration or dizziness 2 2 Clinical Study of Another Sodium Picosulfate, Magnesium Oxide and Anhydrous Citric Acid Product - Study 2 In a randomized, multicenter, investigator-blinded, active-controlled clinical trial for colon cleansing in adults, another oral sodium picosulfate, magnesium oxide, and anhydrous citric acid product was compared with a regimen of two liters (2 L) of polyethylene glycol plus electrolytes solution (PEG + E) and two 5-mg bisacodyl tablets (Study 2). In this study the protocol specified that abdominal bloating, distention, pain/cramping, and watery diarrhea, which are known to occur in response to bowel preparation, were documented as adverse events only if they required medical intervention (such as a change in study drug or led to discontinuation, therapeutic or diagnostic procedures, met the criteria for serious adverse event) or showed clinically significant worsening during the study that was not in the frame of the usual clinical course, as determined by the investigator. The most common adverse reactions in Study 2 are shown in Table 2. Table 2: Common Adverse Reactions abdominal bloating, distention, pain/cramping, and watery diarrhea not requiring an intervention were not collected Observed in at Least 1% of Patients Undergoing Colon Cleansing in Study 2 Adverse Reaction Split-Dose Regimen Sodium picosulfate, magnesium oxide, and anhydrous citric acid (N=305) % 2 L PEG + E 2 L PEG + E = two liters polyethylene glycol plus electrolytes solution with 2 × 5-mg bisacodyl tablets (N=298) % Nausea 3 4 Headache 2 2 Vomiting 1 3 Electrolyte Abnormalities In Study 1, rates of abnormal electrolyte shifts were generally similar between CLENPIQ and another sodium picosulfate, magnesium oxide, and anhydrous citric acid product (Table 3). In general, these shifts were transient and not clinically significant. In Study 2, sodium picosulfate, magnesium oxide, and anhydrous citric acid was in general associated with numerically higher rates of abnormal electrolyte shifts on the day of colonoscopy compared to the control regimen (Table 3). These shifts were transient in nature and numerically similar between treatment arms at the Day 28 visit.

Electrolytes abnormalities were observed in pediatric patients similar to those seen in adults. Three patients had abnormally low glucose levels (40 to 47 mg/dL). Two patients received sodium picosulfate, magnesium oxide, and anhydrous citric acid and one received the comparator (PEG). The abnormal values occurred at the colonoscopy visit for one patient (sodium picosulfate, magnesium oxide, and anhydrous citric acid) and at the 5-day follow up visit for the other two patients (sodium picosulfate, magnesium oxide, and anhydrous citric acid and PEG). All three patients were asymptomatic. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of oral sodium picosulfate, magnesium oxide, and anhydrous citric acid products. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hypersensitivity : rash, urticaria, and purpura Gastrointestinal: abdominal pain, diarrhea, fecal incontinence, proctalgia, vomiting, reversible aphthoid ileal ulcers, and ischemic colitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Neurologic: generalized tonic-clonic seizures with and without hyponatremia in epileptic patients, and syncope [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2 , 5.5) ] ."

          "title": "Special Populations",
          "content": "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no data with CLENPIQ use in pregnant women to determine a drug-associated risk of adverse developmental outcomes. In animal reproduction studies, no adverse developmental effects were observed in pregnant rats when sodium picosulfate, magnesium oxide, and anhydrous citric acid were administered orally at doses 1.2 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area during organogenesis. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Reproduction studies with sodium picosulfate, magnesium oxide, and anhydrous citric acid have been performed in pregnant rats following oral administration of up to 2000 mg/kg twice daily (about 1.2 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area) during the period of organogenesis. There was no evidence of harm to the fetus due to sodium picosulfate, magnesium oxide, and anhydrous citric acid. The reproduction study in rabbits was not adequate, as treatment-related mortalities were observed at all doses. A pre and postnatal development study with sodium picosulfate, magnesium oxide, and anhydrous citric acid in rats showed no evidence of any adverse effect on pre and postnatal development at oral doses up to 2000 mg/kg twice daily (about 1.2 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area). Published reproduction studies with sodium picosulfate in pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis did not show evidence of harm to the fetus at doses up to 100 mg/kg (approximately 49 and 98 times, respectively, the recommended human dose of 10 mg sodium picosulfate based on body surface area). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of magnesium oxide or anhydrous citric acid in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Published data on lactating women indicate that the active metabolite of sodium picosulfate, bis-( p -hydroxyphenyl)-pyridyl-2-methane (BHPM) remained below the limit of detection (1 ng/mL) in breast milk after both single and multiple doses of 10 mg/day. There are no data on the effects of sodium picosulfate on the breastfed infant or on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for CLENPIQ and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from CLENPIQ or the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of CLENPIQ have been established for cleansing of the colon as a preparation for colonoscopy in pediatric patients 9 years of age and older. Use of CLENPIQ in this age group is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled trials in adults and a single, dose-ranging, controlled trial in 78 pediatric patients 9 to 16 years of age all of which evaluated another oral product of sodium picosulfate, magnesium oxide, and anhydrous citric acid [see Clinical Studies (14) ]. The safety profile in this pediatric population was similar to that seen in adults [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Monitor for possible hypoglycemia in pediatric patients, as CLENPIQ has no caloric substrate. The safety and effectiveness of CLENPIQ in pediatric patients less than 9 years of age have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the 448 adult patients in Study 1 who received CLENPIQ, 124 (28%) patients were 65 years of age or older. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between geriatric patients and younger patients, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between elderly and younger patients. Elderly patients are more likely to have decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and may be more susceptible to adverse reactions resulting from fluid and electrolyte abnormalities [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. 8.6 Renal Impairment CLENPIQ is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min), as accumulation of magnesium in plasma may occur [see Contraindications (4) ] . Patients with less severe renal impairment or patients taking concomitant medications that may affect renal function may be at increased risk for renal injury [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Advise these patients of the importance of adequate hydration before, during, and after the use of CLENPIQ [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] . Consider performing baseline and post-colonoscopy laboratory tests (electrolytes, creatinine, and BUN) in these patients."

( 5.3 , 7.1 ) • Patients with renal impairment or taking concomitant medications that affect renal function: Use caution, ensure adequate hydration and consider testing. ( 5.4 , 7.1 , 8.6 ) • Mucosal ulcerations : Consider potential for mucosal ulcerations when interpreting colonoscopy findings in patients with known or suspected inflammatory bowel disease. ( 5.5 ) • Suspected GI obstruction or perforation : Rule out diagnosis before administration. ( 4 , 5.6 ) • Patients at risk for aspiration : Observe during administration. ( 5.7 ) • Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PD): Use with caution. ( 5.8 ) • Risks in patients with phenylketonuria : Contains phenylalanine. ( 5.9 ) • Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis: Inform patients to seek immediate medical care if symptoms occur. ( 5.10 ) 5.1 Serious Fluid and Electrolyte Abnormalities Advise patients to hydrate adequately before, during, and after the use of PLENVU. If a patient develops significant vomiting or signs of dehydration after taking PLENVU, consider performing post-colonoscopy laboratory tests (electrolytes, creatinine, and BUN). Bowel preparations can cause fluid and electrolyte disturbances, which can lead to serious adverse reactions including cardiac arrhythmias, seizures, and renal impairment. Correct fluid and electrolyte abnormalities before treatment with PLENVU. PLENVU should be used with caution in patients using concomitant medications that increase the risk of electrolyte abnormalities [such as diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)] [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . Consider performing pre-dose and post-colonoscopy laboratory tests (sodium, potassium, calcium, creatinine, and BUN) in patients receiving these concomitant medications. 5.2 Cardiac Arrhythmias There have been rare reports of serious arrhythmias (including atrial fibrillation) associated with the use of ionic osmotic laxative products for bowel preparation. These occur predominantly in patients with underlying cardiac risk factors and electrolyte disturbances. Use caution when prescribing PLENVU for patients at increased risk of arrhythmias (e.g., patients with a history of prolonged QT, uncontrolled arrhythmias, recent myocardial infarction, unstable angina, congestive heart failure, cardiomyopathy or electrolyte imbalance). Consider pre-dose and post-colonoscopy ECGs in patients at increased risk of serious cardiac arrhythmias. 5.3 Seizures There have been rare reports of generalized tonic-clonic seizures and/or loss of consciousness associated with use of bowel preparation products in patients with no prior history of seizures. The seizure cases were associated with electrolyte abnormalities (e.g., hyponatremia, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, and hypomagnesemia) and low serum osmolality. The neurologic abnormalities resolved with correction of fluid and electrolyte abnormalities. Use caution when prescribing PLENVU for patients with a history of seizures and in patients at increased risk of seizure, such as patients taking medications that lower the seizure threshold (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants), patients withdrawing from alcohol or benzodiazepines, or patients with known or suspected hyponatremia. [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )]. 5.4 Use in Patients with Renal Impairment Use PLENVU with caution in patients with renal impairment or patients taking concomitant medications that affect renal function (such as diuretics, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . These patients may be at risk for renal injury. Advise these patients of the importance of adequate hydration before, during and after the use of PLENVU, and consider performing pre-dose and post-colonoscopy laboratory tests (electrolytes, creatinine, and BUN) in these patients [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . 5.5 Colonic Mucosal Ulceration, Ischemic Colitis and Ulcerative Colitis Osmotic laxatives may produce colonic mucosal aphthous ulcerations, and there have been reports of more serious cases of ischemic colitis requiring hospitalization. Concurrent use of stimulant laxatives and PLENVU may increase the risk and is not recommended. Consider the potential for mucosal ulcerations resulting from the bowel preparation when interpreting colonoscopy findings in patients with known or suspected inflammatory bowel disease. 5.6 Use in Patients with Significant Gastrointestinal Disease If gastrointestinal obstruction or perforation is suspected, perform appropriate diagnostic studies to rule out these conditions before administering PLENVU [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . Use with caution in patients with severe ulcerative colitis. 5.7 Aspiration Patients with impaired gag reflex or other swallowing abnormalities are at risk for regurgitation or aspiration of PLENVU. Observe these patients during the administration of PLENVU. Use with caution in these patients. Do not combine PLENVU with starch-based thickeners [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )]. Polyethylene glycol (PEG), a component of PLENVU, when mixed with starch-thickened liquids reduces the viscosity of the starch-thickened liquid. When a PEG-based product used for another indication was mixed in starch-based pre-thickened liquids used in patients with dysphagia, thinning of the liquid occurred and cases of choking and potential aspiration were reported. 5.8 Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (G6PD) Deficiency Since PLENVU contains sodium ascorbate and ascorbic acid, PLENVU should be used with caution in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, especially G6PD deficiency patients with an active infection, with a history of hemolysis, or taking concomitant medications known to precipitate hemolytic reactions. 5.9 Risks in Patients with Phenylketonuria Phenylalanine can be harmful to patients with phenylketonuria (PKU). PLENVU contains phenylalanine, a component of aspartame. Each PLENVU treatment contains 491 mg of phenylalanine. Before prescribing PLENVU to a patient with PKU, consider the combined daily amount of phenylalanine from all sources, including PLENVU. 5.10 Hypersensitivity Reactions PLENVU contains PEG and may cause serious hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis, angioedema, rash, urticaria, and pruritus [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 , 6.2 )] . Inform patients of the signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis, and instruct them to seek immediate medical care should signs and symptoms occur."

The safety of PLENVU Two-Day Split Dosage and One-Day Morning Dosage regimens was evaluated in two randomized, parallel group, multicenter, investigator-blinded clinical trials (Two-Day Split Dosage in the NOCT and MORA trials and One-Day Morning Dosage in the MORA trial) in 1351 adult patients undergoing colonoscopy. The mean age of the study population was 56 years (range 18 to 86 years), 92% of patients were Caucasian and 51% were female. In the NOCT trial, 61% of patients had mild renal impairment. In the MORA trial, 67% had mild renal impairment and 5% had moderate renal impairment. Patients with severe renal impairment were not enrolled in the clinical trials of PLENVU [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )]. The most common adverse reactions (>2%) in the PLENVU treatment groups in both trials were: nausea, vomiting, dehydration and abdominal pain/discomfort. Table 1 and Table 2 display adverse reactions reported in at least 1% of patients in one or more treatment group(s) in the NOCT and MORA trials, respectively.

The majority of these changes were transient and not clinically significant. Associated decreases in bicarbonate and increases in serum osmolality were also noted. Renal Function Decreases in creatinine clearance and increases in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) were also noted in more patients treated with PLENVU compared to control in both trials. Changes of a magnitude indicative of possible acute renal injury, or worsening of baseline chronic renal impairment, were noted infrequently and occurred at a similar incidence in both PLENVU and comparator arms. Adverse reactions in patients with mild renal impairment were similar to those in patients with normal renal function . Less Common Adverse Reactions Less common adverse reactions (less than 1%) in the NOCT and MORA trials include: anorectal discomfort, hypersensitivity reaction (including rash), migraine, somnolence, asthenia, chills, pains, aches, palpitation, sinus tachycardia, hot flush, and transient increase in liver enzymes. An additional 235 patients were exposed to the One-Day Morning Dosage Regimen of PLENVU in a third clinical trial, utilizing a comparator not approved in the United States. The adverse reaction profile for patients receiving PLENVU in that trial was similar to what is described above. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of another oral formulation of polyethylene glycol 3350, sodium ascorbate, sodium sulfate, ascorbic acid, sodium chloride and potassium chloride or other polyethylene glycol (PEG)-based bowel preparations. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hypersensitivity: urticaria/rash, pruritus, dermatitis, rhinorrhea dyspnea, chest and throat tightness, fever, angioedema, anaphylaxis and anaphylactic shock [see Contraindications ( 4 )] Cardiovascular: arrhythmia, atrial fibrillation, peripheral edema, asystole, and acute pulmonary edema after aspiration Gastrointestinal: upper gastrointestinal bleeding from a Mallory-Weiss tear, esophageal perforation [usually with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)] Nervous system: tremor, seizure"

Consider additional patient evaluations as appropriate. 7.2 Potential for Reduced Drug Absorption PLENVU can reduce the absorption of other coadministered oral drugs . Administer oral medications at least 1 hour before starting each dose of PLENVU [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )]. 7.3 Stimulant Laxatives Concurrent use of stimulant laxatives and PLENVU may increase the risk of mucosal ulceration or ischemic colitis. Avoid use of stimulant laxatives (e.g., bisacodyl, sodium picosulfate) while taking PLENVU [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] ."

          "content": "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data with PLENVU in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk for adverse developmental outcomes. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with PLENVU. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data available to assess the presence of PLENVU in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child or the effects on milk production. The lack of clinical data during lactation precludes a clear determination of the risk of PLENVU to a child during lactation; therefore, the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for PLENVU and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from PLENVU or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of PLENVU in pediatric patients has not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the approximately 1,000 patients in clinical trials receiving PLENVU, 217 (21%) patients were over 65 years of age. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between geriatric patients and younger patients, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between geriatric patients and younger patients. However, elderly patients are more likely to have decreased hepatic, renal or cardiac function and may be more susceptible to adverse reactions resulting from fluid and electrolyte abnormalities [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . 8.6 Renal Impairment Use PLENVU with caution in patients with renal impairment or patients taking concomitant medications that may affect renal function [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . These patients may be at risk for renal injury. Advise these patients of the importance of adequate hydration before, during and after the use of PLENVU, and consider performing baseline and post-colonoscopy laboratory tests (electrolytes, creatinine, and BUN) in these patients [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] ."

          "title": "Precautions",
          "content": "PRECAUTIONS General Patients with impaired gag reflex, unconscious or semiconscious patients and patients prone to regurgitation or aspiration should be observed during the administration of GaviLyte- C with flavor pack, especially if it is administered via nasogastric tube. If gastrointestinal obstruction or perforation is suspected appropriate studies should be performed to rule out these conditions before administration of GaviLyte- C with flavor pack. INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS GaviLyte- C with flavor pack produces a watery stool which cleanses the bowel prior to examination. For best results, no solid food should be ingested during the 3 to 4 hour period prior to the initiation of GaviLyte- C with flavor pack administration. In no case should solid foods be eaten within 2 hours of drinking GaviLyte- C with flavor pack. The rate of administration is 240 mL (8 fl. oz.) every 10 minutes. Rapid drinking of each portion is preferred rather than drinking small amounts continuously. The first bowel movement should occur approximately one hour after the start of GaviLyte- C with flavor pack administration. Administration of GaviLyte- C with flavor pack should be continued until the watery stool is clear and free of solid matter. This normally requires the consumption of approximately 3 to 4 liters (3 to 4 quarts), although more or less may be required in some patients. The unused portion should be discarded. DRUG INTERACTIONS Oral medication administered within one hour of start of administration of GaviLyte- C with flavor pack may be flushed from the gastrointestinal tract and not absorbed. CARCINOGENESIS, MUTAGENESIS, IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY Studies to evaluate carcinogenic or mutagenic potential or potential to adversely affect male or female fertility have not been performed. PREGNANCY Category C. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with GaviLyte- C with flavor pack, and it is not known whether GaviLyte- C with flavor pack can affect reproductive capacity or harm the fetus when administered to a pregnant patient. GaviLyte- C with flavor pack should be given to a pregnant patient only if clearly needed. PEDIATRIC USE Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. GERIATRIC USE Published literature contains isolated reports of serious adverse reactions following the administration of PEG-ELS products in patients over 60 years of age. These adverse events include upper GI bleeding from Mallory-Weiss Tear, esophageal perforation, asystole, sudden dyspnea with pulmonary edema, and \"butterfly-like\" infiltrate on chest x-ray after vomiting and aspirating PEG."

Ensure completion of Dose 2, including all additional liquids, at least 2 hours before the colonoscopy. Storage : After reconstitution, store PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution- solution in an upright position and keep refrigerated. Use within 24 hours after it is mixed in water. 2.2 Two-Day Split-Dosing Regimen (Preferred Method) The Two-Day Split-Dosing regimen is the preferred dosing method. Instruct adult patients that on the day before the clinical procedure, they can consume breakfast, followed by a light lunch (no solid foods), and clear soup and/or plain yogurt for dinner, which must be completed at least 1 hour prior to the start of the first PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution dose. Instruct adult patients to take two separate doses in conjunction with fluids as follows: Dose 1 – In the evening before the colonoscopy, approximately 10 to 12 hours before Dose 2: Empty the contents of 1 Pouch A, 1 Pouch B and 1 Lemon Flavor pack into the mixing container that comes with PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution. Add lukewarm water to the Fill Line on the mixing container (32 fluid ounces). Do not add other ingredients to the PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution- solution. Thoroughly mix with a spoon or shake with lid on securely until the contents of Pouch A, Pouch B and Lemon flavor pack are completely dissolved. Drink 8 ounces of the solution every 15 minutes. This should take about 1 hour. Be sure to drink all the solution. Refill the mixing container halfway to the Fill Line (at least 16 ounces) with a clear liquid and drink all this liquid before going to bed. Dose 2 – Take next morning, on the day of the colonoscopy, approximately 12 hours after the start of Dose 1 and at least 3 ½ hours prior to colonoscopy: Empty the contents of 1 Pouch A, 1 Pouch B and 1 Lemon flavor pack into the mixing container that comes with PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution. Add lukewarm water to the Fill Line on the mixing container (32 fluid ounces). Do not add other ingredients to the PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution- solution. Thoroughly mix with a spoon or shake with lid on securely until the contents of Pouch A, Pouch B and Lemon flavor pack are completely dissolved. Drink 8 ounces of the solution every 15 minutes. This should take about 1 hour. Be sure to drink all of the solution. Refill the mixing container halfway to the Fill Line (at least 16 ounces) with a clear liquid and drink all this liquid at least 2 hours before the colonoscopy. Consume additional water or clear liquids up to 2 hours before the colonoscopy or as prescribed by your healthcare provider. Then stop drinking liquids until after the colonoscopy. Stop drinking PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution temporarily or drink each portion at longer intervals if severe bloating, abdominal discomfort or distention occurs, until these symptoms resolve. 2.3 One-Day Evening Only Dosing Regimen (Alternative Method) The One-Day Evening Only regimen is the alternative dosing method for patients for whom the Split-Dosing regimen is inappropriate. Instruct adult patients that on the day before the clinical procedure, they can consume breakfast, followed by a light lunch (no solid foods), and clear soup and/or plain yogurt for dinner, which must be completed at least 1 hour prior to the start of the first PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution dose. Instruct adult patients to take two separate doses in conjunction with fluids as follows: Dose 1 – At least 3 ½ hours before bedtime the evening before the colonoscopy : Empty the contents of 1 Pouch A, 1 Pouch B and 1 Lemon Flavor pack into the mixing container that comes with PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution. Add lukewarm water to the Fill Line on the mixing container (32 fluid ounces). Do not add other ingredients to the PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution- solution. Thoroughly mix with a spoon or shake with lid on securely until the contents of Pouch A, Pouch B and Lemon Flavor pack are completely dissolved. Drink 8 ounces of the solution every 15 minutes. This should take about 1 hour. Be sure to drink all the solution. Dose 2 – At least 1 ½ hours after starting Dose 1 on the evening before the colonoscopy : Empty the contents of 1 Pouch A, 1 Pouch B and 1 Lemon Flavor pack into the mixing container that comes with PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution. Add lukewarm water to the Fill Line on the mixing container (32 fluid ounces). Do not add other ingredients to the PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution- solution. Thoroughly mix with a spoon or shake with lid on securely until the contents of Pouch A, Pouch B and Lemon Flavor pack are completely dissolved. Drink 8 ounces of the solution every 15 minutes. This should take about 1 hour. Be sure to drink all of the solution. Refill the mixing container to the Fill Line (32 fluid ounces) with a clear liquid and drink all this liquid before going to bed. Consume additional water or clear liquids up to 2 hours before the colonoscopy or as prescribed by your healthcare provider. Then stop drinking liquids until after the colonoscopy. Stop drinking PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution temporarily or drink each portion at longer intervals if severe bloating, abdominal discomfort or distention occurs, until these symptoms resolve."

          "content": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Risk of fluid and electrolyte abnormalities : Encourage adequate hydration, assess concurrent medications, and consider laboratory assessments prior to and after use. ( 5.1 , 7.1 ) Cardiac arrhythmias : Consider pre-dose and post-colonoscopy ECGs in patients at increased risk. (5.2) Seizures: Use caution in patients with a history of seizures and patients at increased risk of seizure, including medications that lower the seizure threshold. ( 5.3 , 7.1 ) Patients with renal impairment or taking concomitant medications that affect renal function : Use caution, ensure adequate hydration and consider laboratory testing. ( 5.4 , 7.1 , 8.6 ) Colonic mucosal ulcerations : Consider potential for ulcerations when interpreting colonoscopy findings in patients with known or suspected inflammatory bowel disease. ( 5.5 ) Suspected GI obstruction or perforation : Rule out the diagnosis before administration. ( 5.6 ) Patients at risk for aspiration : Observe during administration. ( 5.7 ) Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G-6-PD) : Use with caution. ( 5.8 ) Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis : Inform patients to seek immediate medical care if symptoms occur. ( 5.10 ) 5.1 Serious Fluid and Electrolyte Abnormalities Advise patients to hydrate adequately before, during, and after the use of PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution. If a patient develops significant vomiting or signs of dehydration after taking PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution, consider performing post-colonoscopy lab tests (electrolytes, creatinine, and BUN). Bowel preparations can cause fluid and electrolyte disturbances, which can lead to serious adverse reactions including cardiac arrhythmias, seizures, and renal impairment [ see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . Correct fluid and electrolyte abnormalities before treatment with PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution. PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution should be used with caution in patients using concomitant medications that increase the risk of electrolyte abnormalities [such as diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)] or in patients with known or suspected hyponatremia. Consider performing pre-dose and post-colonoscopy laboratory tests (sodium, potassium, calcium, creatinine, and BUN) in these patients [ see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. 5.2 Cardiac Arrhythmias There have been rare reports of serious arrhythmias (including atrial fibrillation) associated with the use of ionic osmotic laxative products for bowel preparation. These occur predominantly in patients with underlying cardiac risk factors and electrolyte disturbances. Use caution when prescribing PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution for patients at increased risk of arrhythmias (e.g., patients with a history of prolonged QT, uncontrolled arrhythmias, recent myocardial infarction, unstable angina, congestive heart failure, cardiomyopathy, or electrolyte imbalance). Consider pre-dose and post-colonoscopy ECGs in patients at increased risk of serious cardiac arrhythmias. 5.3 Seizures There have been rare reports of generalized tonic-clonic seizures and/or loss of consciousness associated with use of bowel preparation products in patients with no prior history of seizures. The seizure cases were associated with electrolyte abnormalities (e.g., hyponatremia, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, and hypomagnesemia) and low serum osmolality. The neurologic abnormalities resolved with correction of fluid and electrolyte abnormalities. Use caution when prescribing PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution for patients with a history of seizures and in patients at increased risk of seizure, such as patients taking medications that lower the seizure threshold (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants), patients withdrawing from alcohol or benzodiazepines, or patients with known or suspected hyponatremia [ see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . 5.4 Use in Patients with Renal Impairment Use PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution with caution in patients with renal impairment or patients taking concomitant medications that affect renal function (such as diuretics, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) [ see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . These patients may be at risk for renal injury. Advise these patients of the importance of adequate hydration before, during, and after use of PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution, and consider performing pre-dose and post-colonoscopy laboratory tests (electrolytes, creatinine, and BUN) in these patients [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . 5.5 Colonic Mucosal Ulceration, Ischemic Colitis and Ulcerative Colitis Osmotic laxatives may produce colonic mucosal aphthous ulcerations, and there have been reports of more serious cases of ischemic colitis requiring hospitalization. Concurrent use of stimulant laxatives and PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution may increase the risk of mucosal ulceration or ischemic colitis and is not recommended. Consider the potential for mucosal ulcerations resulting from the bowel preparation when interpreting colonoscopy findings in patients with known or suspected inflammatory bowel disease. 5.6 Use in Patients with Significant Gastrointestinal Disease If gastrointestinal obstruction or perforation is suspected, perform appropriate diagnostic studies to rule out these conditions before administering PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution [ see Contraindications (4) ] . Use with caution in patients with severe ulcerative colitis. 5.7 Aspiration Patients with impaired gag reflex or other swallowing abnormalities are at risk for regurgitation or aspiration of PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution. Observe these patients during the administration of PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution. Use with caution in these patients. Do not combine PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution with starch-based thickeners [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )] . Polyethylene glycol (PEG), a component of PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution, when mixed with starch-thickened liquids reduces the viscosity of the starch-thickened liquid. When a PEG-based product used for another indication was mixed in starch-based pre-thickened liquids used in patients with dysphagia, thinning of the liquid occurred and cases of choking and potential aspiration were reported. 5.8 Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (G6PD) Deficiency Since PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution contains sodium ascorbate and ascorbic acid, PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution should be used with caution in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, especially G6PD deficiency patients with an active infection, with a history of hemolysis, or taking concomitant medications known to precipitate hemolytic reactions. 5.10 Hypersensitivity Reactions PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution contains polyethylene glycol (PEG) and lemon flavoring (containing Natural Lemon Flavor, Maltodextrin and Saccharin Sodium) and may cause serious hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis, angioedema, rash, urticaria, and pruritus [see Contraindications ( 4 ), Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ) and Description ( 11 )] . Inform patients of the signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis, and instruct them to seek immediate medical care should signs and symptoms occur."

The safety of PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution as a Two-Day Split-Dosing and One-Day Evening Only Dosing Regimen was evaluated in two randomized, active-controlled, multicenter, investigator-blinded clinical trials in adult patients scheduled to have an elective colonoscopy [see Clinical Studies (14)] . The safety analysis for Study 1 included 359 adult patients ranging in age from 18 to 88 years (mean age 59), with 52% female and 48% male patients. The safety analysis for Study 2 included 340 adult patients ranging in age from 21 to 76 years (mean age 53), with 53% male and 47% female patients. Tables 1 and 2 display adverse reactions reported in at least 2% and 5% of patients in either treatment group in Study 1 and Study 2, respectively. Since diarrhea was considered as a part of the efficacy assessment, it was not defined as an adverse reaction in these trials.

          "content": "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk for adverse developmental outcomes. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data available on the presence of PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution in human milk, the effects of the drug on the breastfed child, or the effects of the drug on milk production. The lack of clinical data during lactation precludes a clear determination of the risk of PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution to a child during lactation; therefore, the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the 413 patients in clinical trials receiving PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution, 91 (22%) patients were aged 65 or older, while 25 (6%) patients were over 75 years of age. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between geriatric patients and younger patients, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between geriatric patients and younger patients. However, elderly patients are more likely to have decreased hepatic, renal or cardiac function and may be more susceptible to adverse reactions resulting from fluid and electrolyte abnormalities [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . 8.6 Renal Impairment Use PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution with caution in patients with renal impairment or patients taking concomitant medications that may affect renal function [see Drug Interactions (7.1)] . These patients may be at risk for renal injury. Advise these patients of the importance of adequate hydration before, during and after the use of PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution, and consider performing baseline and post-colonoscopy laboratory tests (electrolytes, creatinine, and BUN) in these patients [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] ."

( 2.1 ) Dosing Regimen: Two-Day (Split-Dose) (Preferred Method) : Dose 1 the evening before the colonoscopy, and Dose 2 the morning of the colonoscopy (approximately 12 hours after the start of Dose 1, and at least 3 ½ hours prior to the colonoscopy). ( 2.2 ) One-Day (Evening Only) (Alternative Method) : Dose 1 at least 3 ½ hours prior to bedtime the evening before the colonoscopy and Dose 2 approximately 1 ½ hours after starting Dose 1 the evening before the colonoscopy. ( 2.3 ) For complete information on dosing, preparation and administration see full prescribing information ( 2.1 , 2.2 , 2.3 ) 2.1 Important Preparation and Administration Instructions Correct fluid and electrolyte abnormalities before treatment with PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Two doses of PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution are required for a complete preparation for colonoscopy. The time interval between the two doses depends on the regimen prescribed and the planned timing of the colonoscopy procedure. [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 , 2.3 ) ] . The \"Split-Dose\" is the preferred method and consists of two separate doses: the first dose is taken the evening before the colonoscopy, and the second dose is taken the next day, the morning of the day of the colonoscopy [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. The \"Evening Only\" is the alternative method and consists of two separate doses: both doses are taken in the evening before the day of the colonoscopy, with a minimum of 1.5 hours between the start of the first dose and the start of the second dose [ see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ]. Both PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution dosing regimens require administration of PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution using the mixing container provided to reconstitute the contents of Pouch A, Pouch B and Lemon flavor pack with water to the Fill Line. Do not reconstitute with other liquids and/or add starch-based thickeners to the mixing container [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ]. Additional clear liquids (including water) must be consumed in both dosing regimens [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 , 2.3 ), Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Consume only clear liquids (no solid food) from the start of PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution treatment until after the colonoscopy. Do not eat or drink alcohol, milk, anything colored red or purple or any other foods containing pulp material. Do not take other laxatives while taking PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution [ see Drug Interactions (7.3) ] . Do not take oral medications within 1 hour before or after starting each dose of PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution [ see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. Ensure completion of Dose 2, including all additional liquids, at least 2 hours before the colonoscopy. Storage : After reconstitution, store PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution- solution in an upright position and keep refrigerated. Use within 24 hours after it is mixed in water. 2.2 Two-Day Split-Dosing Regimen (Preferred Method) The Two-Day Split-Dosing regimen is the preferred dosing method. Instruct adult patients that on the day before the clinical procedure, they can consume breakfast, followed by a light lunch (no solid foods), and clear soup and/or plain yogurt for dinner, which must be completed at least 1 hour prior to the start of the first PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution dose. Instruct adult patients to take two separate doses in conjunction with fluids as follows: Dose 1 – In the evening before the colonoscopy, approximately 10 to 12 hours before Dose 2: Empty the contents of 1 Pouch A, 1 Pouch B and 1 Lemon Flavor pack into the mixing container that comes with PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution.

          "content": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Risk of fluid and electrolyte abnormalities : Encourage adequate hydration, assess concurrent medications, and consider laboratory assessments prior to and after use. ( 5.1 , 7.1 ) Cardiac arrhythmias : Consider pre-dose and post-colonoscopy ECGs in patients at increased risk. (5.2) Seizures: Use caution in patients with a history of seizures and patients at increased risk of seizure, including medications that lower the seizure threshold. ( 5.3 , 7.1 ) Patients with renal impairment or taking concomitant medications that affect renal function : Use caution, ensure adequate hydration and consider laboratory testing. ( 5.4 , 7.1 , 8.6 ) Colonic mucosal ulcerations : Consider potential for ulcerations when interpreting colonoscopy findings in patients with known or suspected inflammatory bowel disease. ( 5.5 ) Suspected GI obstruction or perforation : Rule out the diagnosis before administration. ( 5.6 ) Patients at risk for aspiration : Observe during administration. ( 5.7 ) Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G-6-PD) : Use with caution. ( 5.8 ) Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis : Inform patients to seek immediate medical care if symptoms occur. ( 5.10 ) 5.1 Serious Fluid and Electrolyte Abnormalities Advise patients to hydrate adequately before, during, and after the use of PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution. If a patient develops significant vomiting or signs of dehydration after taking PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution, consider performing post-colonoscopy lab tests (electrolytes, creatinine, and BUN). Bowel preparations can cause fluid and electrolyte disturbances, which can lead to serious adverse reactions including cardiac arrhythmias, seizures, and renal impairment [ see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . Correct fluid and electrolyte abnormalities before treatment with PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution. PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution should be used with caution in patients using concomitant medications that increase the risk of electrolyte abnormalities [such as diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)] or in patients with known or suspected hyponatremia. Consider performing pre-dose and post-colonoscopy laboratory tests (sodium, potassium, calcium, creatinine, and BUN) in these patients [ see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. 5.2 Cardiac Arrhythmias There have been rare reports of serious arrhythmias (including atrial fibrillation) associated with the use of ionic osmotic laxative products for bowel preparation. These occur predominantly in patients with underlying cardiac risk factors and electrolyte disturbances. Use caution when prescribing PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution for patients at increased risk of arrhythmias (e.g., patients with a history of prolonged QT, uncontrolled arrhythmias, recent myocardial infarction, unstable angina, congestive heart failure, cardiomyopathy, or electrolyte imbalance). Consider pre-dose and post-colonoscopy ECGs in patients at increased risk of serious cardiac arrhythmias. 5.3 Seizures There have been rare reports of generalized tonic-clonic seizures and/or loss of consciousness associated with use of bowel preparation products in patients with no prior history of seizures. The seizure cases were associated with electrolyte abnormalities (e.g., hyponatremia, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, and hypomagnesemia) and low serum osmolality. The neurologic abnormalities resolved with correction of fluid and electrolyte abnormalities. Use caution when prescribing PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution for patients with a history of seizures and in patients at increased risk of seizure, such as patients taking medications that lower the seizure threshold (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants), patients withdrawing from alcohol or benzodiazepines, or patients with known or suspected hyponatremia [ see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . 5.4 Use in Patients with Renal Impairment Use PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution with caution in patients with renal impairment or patients taking concomitant medications that affect renal function (such as diuretics, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) [ see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . These patients may be at risk for renal injury. Advise these patients of the importance of adequate hydration before, during, and after use of PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution, and consider performing pre-dose and post-colonoscopy laboratory tests (electrolytes, creatinine, and BUN) in these patients [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . 5.5 Colonic Mucosal Ulceration, Ischemic Colitis and Ulcerative Colitis Osmotic laxatives may produce colonic mucosal aphthous ulcerations, and there have been reports of more serious cases of ischemic colitis requiring hospitalization. Concurrent use of stimulant laxatives and PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution may increase the risk of mucosal ulceration or ischemic colitis and is not recommended. Consider the potential for mucosal ulcerations resulting from the bowel preparation when interpreting colonoscopy findings in patients with known or suspected inflammatory bowel disease. 5.6 Use in Patients with Significant Gastrointestinal Disease If gastrointestinal obstruction or perforation is suspected, perform appropriate diagnostic studies to rule out these conditions before administering PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution [ see Contraindications (4) ] . Use with caution in patients with severe ulcerative colitis. 5.7 Aspiration Patients with impaired gag reflex or other swallowing abnormalities are at risk for regurgitation or aspiration of PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution. Observe these patients during the administration of PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution. Use with caution in these patients. Do not combine PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution with starch-based thickeners [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )] . Polyethylene glycol (PEG), a component of PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution, when mixed with starch-thickened liquids reduces the viscosity of the starch-thickened liquid. When a PEG-based product used for another indication was mixed in starch-based pre-thickened liquids used in patients with dysphagia, thinning of the liquid occurred and cases of choking and potential aspiration were reported. 5.8 Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (G6PD) Deficiency Since PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution contains sodium ascorbate and ascorbic acid, PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution should be used with caution in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, especially G6PD deficiency patients with an active infection, with a history of hemolysis, or taking concomitant medications known to precipitate hemolytic reactions. 5.10 Hypersensitivity Reactions PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution contains polyethylene glycol (PEG) and lemon flavoring (containing Natural Lemon Flavor, Maltodextrin and Saccharin Sodium) and may cause serious hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis, angioedema, rash, urticaria, and pruritus [see Contraindications ( 4 ), Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ) and Description ( 11 )] . Inform patients of the signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis, and instruct them to seek immediate medical care should signs and symptoms occur."

The safety of PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution as a Two-Day Split-Dosing and One-Day Evening Only Dosing Regimen was evaluated in two randomized, active-controlled, multicenter, investigator-blinded clinical trials in adult patients scheduled to have an elective colonoscopy [see Clinical Studies (14)] . The safety analysis for Study 1 included 359 adult patients ranging in age from 18 to 88 years (mean age 59), with 52% female and 48% male patients. The safety analysis for Study 2 included 340 adult patients ranging in age from 21 to 76 years (mean age 53), with 53% male and 47% female patients. Tables 1 and 2 display adverse reactions reported in at least 2% and 5% of patients in either treatment group in Study 1 and Study 2, respectively. Since diarrhea was considered as a part of the efficacy assessment, it was not defined as an adverse reaction in these trials.

          "content": "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk for adverse developmental outcomes. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data available on the presence of PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution in human milk, the effects of the drug on the breastfed child, or the effects of the drug on milk production. The lack of clinical data during lactation precludes a clear determination of the risk of PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution to a child during lactation; therefore, the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the 413 patients in clinical trials receiving PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution, 91 (22%) patients were aged 65 or older, while 25 (6%) patients were over 75 years of age. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between geriatric patients and younger patients, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between geriatric patients and younger patients. However, elderly patients are more likely to have decreased hepatic, renal or cardiac function and may be more susceptible to adverse reactions resulting from fluid and electrolyte abnormalities [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . 8.6 Renal Impairment Use PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution with caution in patients with renal impairment or patients taking concomitant medications that may affect renal function [see Drug Interactions (7.1)] . These patients may be at risk for renal injury. Advise these patients of the importance of adequate hydration before, during and after the use of PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution, and consider performing baseline and post-colonoscopy laboratory tests (electrolytes, creatinine, and BUN) in these patients [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] ."

            "content": "Administration of sodium phosphate products prior to colonoscopy \nfor colon cleansing has resulted in fatalities due to significant fluid shifts, \nsevere electrolyte abnormalities, and cardiac arrhythmias. These fatalities have \nbeen observed in patients with renal insufficiency, in patients with bowel \nperforation, and in patients who misused or overdosed sodium phosphate products. \nIt is recommended that patients receiving OsmoPrep be advised to adequately \nhydrate before, during, and after the use of OsmoPrep. Considerable caution should be advised before OsmoPrep Tablets are used in \npatients with the following illnesses: severe renal insufficiency (creatinine \nclearance less than 30 mL/minute), congestive heart failure, ascites, unstable \nangina, gastric retention, ileus, acute bowel obstruction, pseudo-obstruction of \nthe bowel, severe chronic constipation, bowel perforation, acute colitis, toxic \nmegacolon, gastric bypass or stapling surgery, or hypomotility syndrome. Consider performing baseline and post-colonoscopy labs (phosphate, calcium, \npotassium, sodium, creatinine, and BUN) in patients who may be at increased risk \nfor serious adverse events, including those with history of renal insufficiency, \nhistory of-or at greater risk of-acute phosphate nephropathy, known or suspected \nelectrolyte disorders, seizures, arrhythmias, cardiomyopathy, prolonged QT, \nrecent history of a MI and those with known or suspected hyperphosphatemia, \nhypocalcemia, hypokalemia, and hypernatremia. Also if patients develop vomiting \nand/or signs of dehydration then measure post-colonoscopy labs (phosphate, \ncalcium, potassium, sodium, creatinine, and BUN). Renal Disease, Acute Phosphate Nephropathy, and \nElectrolyte Disorders There have been rare, but serious, reports of renal failure, \nacute phosphate nephropathy, and nephrocalcinosis in patients who received oral \nsodium phosphate products (including oral sodium phosphate solutions and \ntablets) for colon cleansing prior to colonoscopy. These cases often resulted in \npermanent impairment of renal function and several patients required long-term \ndialysis. The time to onset is typically within days; however, in some cases, \nthe diagnosis of these events has been delayed up to several months after the \ningestion of these products. Patients at increased risk of acute phosphate \nnephropathy may include patients with the following: hypovolemia, baseline \nkidney disease, increased age, and patients using medicines that affect renal \nperfusion or function [such as diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme \n(ACE)inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and possibly nonsteroidal \nanti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Use OsmoPrep with caution in patients with impaired renal function, patients \nwith a history of acute phosphate nephropathy, known or suspected electrolyte \ndisturbances (such as dehydration), or people taking concomitant medications \nthat may affect electrolyte levels (such as diuretics). Patients with \nelectrolyte abnormalities such as hypernatremia, hyperphosphatemia, hypokalemia, \nor hypocalcemia should have their electrolytes corrected before treatment with \nOsmoPrep Tablets. Seizures There have been rare reports of generalized tonic-clonic seizures \nand/or loss of consciousness associated with use of sodium phosphate products in \npatients with no prior history of seizures. The seizure cases were associated \nwith electrolyte abnormalities (e.g., hyponatremia, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, \nand hypomagnesemia) and low serum osmolality. The neurologic abnormalities \nresolved with correction of fluid and electrolyte abnormalities. OsmoPrep should \nbe used with caution in patients with a history of seizures and in patients at \nhigher risk of seizure [patients using concomitant medications that lower the \nseizure threshold (such as tricyclic antidepressants), patients withdrawing from \nalcohol or benzodiazepines, or patients with known or suspected \nhyponatremia]. Cardiac Arrhythmias There have been rare, but serious, reports of arrhythmias \nassociated with the use of sodium phosphate products. OsmoPrep should be used \nwith caution in patients with higher risk of arrhythmias (patients with a \nhistory of cardiomyopathy, patients with prolonged QT, patients with a history \nof uncontrolled arrhythmias, and patients with a recent history of a myocardial \ninfarction). Pre-dose and post-colonoscopy ECGs should be considered in patients \nwith high risk of serious, cardiac arrhythmias."

          "content": "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Benzyl alcohol as a preservative has been associated with a fatal “Gasping Syndrome” in premature infants and infants of low birth weight. Solutions used for further dilution of this product should be preservative-free when used in the neonate, especially the premature infant. The initial dosage of parenterally administered Betamethasone Sodium Phosphate and Betamethasone Acetate Injectable Suspension may vary from 0.25 to 9 mg per day depending on the specific disease entity being treated. However, in certain overwhelming, acute, life-threatening situations, administrations in dosages exceeding the usual dosages may be justified and may be in multiples of the oral dosages. It Should Be Emphasized That Dosage Requirements Are Variable and Must Be Individualized on the Basis of the Disease Under Treatment and the Response of the Patient. After a favorable response is noted, the proper maintenance dosage should be determined by decreasing the initial drug dosage in small decrements at appropriate time intervals until the lowest dosage which will maintain an adequate clinical response is reached. Situations which may make dosage adjustments necessary are changes in clinical status secondary to remissions or exacerbations in the disease process, the patient’s individual drug responsiveness, and the effect of patient exposure to stressful situations not directly related to the disease entity under treatment. In this latter situation it may be necessary to increase the dosage of the corticosteroid for a period of time consistent with the patient’s condition. If after long-term therapy the drug is to be stopped, it is recommended that it be withdrawn gradually rather than abruptly. In the treatment of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis, daily doses of 30 mg of betamethasone for a week followed by 12 mg every other day for 1 month are recommended (see PRECAUTIONS, Neuro-psychiatric section). In pediatric patients, the initial dose of betamethasone may vary depending on the specific disease entity being treated. The range of initial doses is 0.02 to 0.3 mg/kg/day in three or four divided doses (0.6 to 9 mg/m 2 bsa/day). For the purpose of comparison, the following is the equivalent milligram dosage of the various glucocorticoids: Cortisone, 25 Triamcinolone, 4 Hydrocortisone, 20 Paramethasone, 2 Prednisolone, 5 Betamethasone, 0.75 Prednisone, 5 Dexamethasone, 0.75 Methylprednisolone, 4 These dose relationships apply only to oral or intravenous administration of these compounds. When these substances or their derivatives are injected intramuscularly or into joint spaces, their relative properties may be greatly altered. If coadministration of a local anesthetic is desired, Betamethasone Sodium Phosphate and Betamethasone Acetate Injectable Suspension may be mixed with 1% or 2% lidocaine hydrochloride, using the formulations which do not contain parabens. Similar local anesthetics may also be used. Diluents containing methylparaben, propylparaben, phenol, etc., should be avoided, since these compounds may cause flocculation of the steroid. The required dose of Betamethasone Sodium Phosphate and Betamethasone Acetate Injectable Suspension is first withdrawn from the vial into the syringe. The local anesthetic is then drawn in, and the syringe shaken briefly. Do not inject local anesthetics into the vial of Betamethasone Sodium Phosphate and Betamethasone Acetate Injectable Suspension. Bursitis, Tenosynovitis, Peritendinitis In acute subdeltoid, subacromial, olecranon, and prepatellar bursitis, one intrabursal injection of 1 mL Betamethasone Sodium Phosphate and Betamethasone Acetate Injectable Suspension can relieve pain and restore full range of movement. Several intrabursal injections of corticosteroids are usually required in recurrent acute bursitis and in acute exacerbations of chronic bursitis. Partial relief of pain and some increase in mobility can be expected in both conditions after one or two injections. Chronic bursitis may be treated with reduced dosage once the acute condition is controlled. In tenosynovitis and tendinitis, three or four local injections at intervals of 1 to 2 weeks between injections are given in most cases. Injections should be made into the affected tendon sheaths rather than into the tendons themselves. In ganglions of joint capsules and tendon sheaths, injection of 0.5 mL directly into the ganglion cysts has produced marked reduction in the size of the lesions. Rheumatoid Arthritis and Osteoarthritis Following intra-articular administration of 0.5 to 2 mL of Betamethasone Sodium Phosphate and Betamethasone Acetate Injectable Suspension, relief of pain, soreness, and stiffness may be experienced. Duration of relief varies widely in both diseases. Intra-articular Injection of Betamethasone Sodium Phosphate and Betamethasone Acetate Injectable Suspension is well tolerated in joints and periarticular tissues. There is virtually no pain on injection, and the “secondary flare” that sometimes occurs a few hours after intra-articular injection of corticosteroids has not been reported with Betamethasone Sodium Phosphate and Betamethasone Acetate Injectable Suspension. Using sterile technique, a 20- to 24-gauge needle on an empty syringe is inserted into the synovial cavity and a few drops of synovial fluid are withdrawn to confirm that the needle is in the joint. The aspirating syringe is replaced by a syringe containing Betamethasone Sodium Phosphate and Betamethasone Acetate Injectable Suspension and injection is then made into the joint. Recommended Doses for Intra-articular Injection Size of Joint Location Dose (mL) Very Large Hip 1 - 2 Large Knee, ankle, shoulder 1 Medium Elbow, wrist 0.5 - 1 Small (metacarpophalangeal, interphalangeal, sternoclavicular) Hand, chest 0.25 to 0.5 A portion of the administered dose of Betamethasone Sodium Phosphate and Betamethasone Acetate Injectable Suspension is absorbed systemically following intra-articular injection. In patients being treated concomitantly with oral or parenteral corticosteroids, especially those receiving large doses, the systemic absorption of the drug should be considered in determining intra-articular dosage. Dermatologic Conditions In intralesional treatment, 0.2 mL/cm 2 of Betamethasone Sodium Phosphate and Betamethasone Acetate Injectable Suspension is injected intradermally (not subcutaneously) using a tuberculin syringe with a 25-gauge, 1/2-inch needle. Care should be taken to deposit a uniform depot of medication intradermally. A total of no more than 1 mL at weekly intervals is recommended. Disorders of the Foot A tuberculin syringe with a 25-gauge, 3/4-inch needle is suitable for most injections into the foot. The following doses are recommended at intervals of 3 days to a week. Diagnosis Betamethasone Sodium Phosphate and Betamethasone Acetate Injectable Suspension Dose (mL) Bursitis under heloma durum or heloma molle 0.25 to 0.5 under calcaneal spur 0.5 over hallux rigidus or digiti quinti varus 0.5 Tenosynovitis, periostitis of cuboid 0.5 Acute gouty arthritis 0.5 to 1"

          "content": "WARNINGS Betamethasone Sodium Phosphate and Betamethasone Acetate Injectable Suspension should not be administered intravenously. Serious Neurologic Adverse Reactions with Epidural Administration Serious neurologic events, some resulting in death, have been reported with epidural injection of corticosteroids. Specific events reported include, but are not limited to, spinal cord infarction, paraplegia, quadriplegia, cortical blindness, and stroke. These serious neurologic events have been reported with and without use of fluoroscopy. The safety and effectiveness of epidural administration of corticosteroids have not been established, and corticosteroids are not approved for this use. General Rare instances of anaphylactoid reactions have occurred in patients receiving corticosteroid therapy (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ). In patients on corticosteroid therapy subjected to any unusual stress, hydrocortisone or cortisone is the drug of choice as a supplement during and after the event. Cardio-Renal Average and large doses of corticosteroids can cause elevation of blood pressure, salt and water retention, and increased excretion of potassium. These effects are less likely to occur with the synthetic derivatives except when used in large doses. Dietary salt restriction and potassium supplementation may be necessary. All corticosteroids increase calcium excretion. Literature reports suggest an apparent association between use of corticosteroids and left ventricular free wall rupture after a recent myocardial infarction; therefore, therapy with corticosteroids should be used with great caution in these patients. Endocrine Corticosteroids can produce reversible hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis suppression with the potential for glucocorticosteroid insufficiency after withdrawal of treatment. Metabolic clearance of corticosteroids is decreased in hypothyroid patients and increased in hyperthyroid patients. Changes in thyroid status of the patient may necessitate adjustment in dosage. Infections General Patients who are on corticosteroids are more susceptible to infections than are healthy individuals. There may be decreased resistance and inability to localize infection when corticosteroids are used. Infection with any pathogen (viral, bacterial, fungal, protozoan, or helminthic) in any location of the body may be associated with the use of corticosteroids alone or in combination with other immunosuppressive agents. These infections may be mild to severe. With increasing doses of corticosteroids, the rate of occurrence of infectious complications increases. Corticosteroids may also mask some signs of current infection. Fungal Infections ​​​Corticosteroids may exacerbate systemic fungal infections and therefore should not be used in the presence of such infections unless they are needed to control drug reactions. There have been cases reported in which concomitant use of amphotericin B and hydrocortisone was followed by cardiac enlargement and congestive heart failure (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions, Amphotericin B Injection and Potassium-Depleting Agents section). Special Pathogens Latent disease may be activated or there may be an exacerbation of intercurrent infections due to pathogens, including those caused by Amoeba, Candida, Cryptococcus, Mycobacterium, Nocardia, Pneumocystis , and Toxoplasma . It is recommended that latent amebiasis or active amebiasis be ruled out before initiating corticosteroid therapy in any patient who has spent time in the tropics or in any patient with unexplained diarrhea. Similarly, corticosteroids should be used with great care in patients with known or suspected Strongyloides (threadworm) infestation. In such patients, corticosteroid-induced immunosuppression may lead to Strongyloides hyperinfection and dissemination with widespread larval migration, often accompanied by severe enterocolitis and potentially fatal gram-negative septicemia. Corticosteroids should not be used in cerebral malaria. Tuberculosis ​ The use of corticosteroids in active tuberculosis should be restricted to those cases of fulminating or disseminated tuberculosis in which the corticosteroid is used for the management of the disease in conjunction with an appropriate antituberculous regimen. If corticosteroids are indicated in patients with latent tuberculosis or tuberculin reactivity, close observation is necessary as reactivation of the disease may occur. During prolonged corticosteroid therapy, these patients should receive chemoprophylaxis. Vaccination Administration of live or live, attenuated vaccines is contraindicated in patients receiving immunosuppressive doses of corticosteroids. Killed or inactivated vaccines may be administered. However, the response to such vaccines cannot be predicted. Immunization procedures may be undertaken in patients who are receiving corticosteroids as replacement therapy, e.g., for Addison’s disease. Viral Infections Chickenpox and measles can have a more serious or even fatal course in pediatric and adult patients on corticosteroids. In pediatric and adult patients who have not had these diseases, particular care should be taken to avoid exposure. The contribution of the underlying disease and/or prior corticosteroid treatment to the risk is also not known. If exposed to chickenpox, prophylaxis with varicella zoster immune globulin (VZIG) may be indicated. If exposed to measles, prophylaxis with immunoglobulin (IG) may be indicated. (See the respective package inserts for complete VZIG and IG prescribing information.) If chickenpox develops, treatment with antiviral agents should be considered. Neurologic Reports of severe medical events have been associated with the intrathecal route of administration (see ADVERSE REACTIONS, Gastrointestinal and Neurologic/Psychiatric sections ). Results from one multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled study with methylprednisolone hemisuccinate, an IV corticosteroid, showed an increase in early mortality (at 2 weeks) and late mortality (at 6 months) in patients with cranial trauma who were determined not to have other clear indications for corticosteroid treatment. High doses of corticosteroids, including Betamethasone Sodium Phosphate and Betamethasone Acetate Injectable Suspension, should not be used for the treatment of traumatic brain injury. Ophthalmic Use of corticosteroids may produce posterior subcapsular cataracts, glaucoma with possible damage to the optic nerves, and may enhance the establishment of secondary ocular infections due to bacteria, fungi, or viruses. The use of oral corticosteroids is not recommended in the treatment of optic neuritis and may lead to an increase in the risk of new episodes. Corticosteroids should not be used in active ocular herpes simplex."

          "title": "Precautions",
          "content": "PRECAUTIONS General This product, like many other steroid formulations, is sensitive to heat. Therefore, it should not be autoclaved when it is desirable to sterilize the exterior of the vial. The lowest possible dose of corticosteroid should be used to control the condition under treatment. When reduction in dosage is possible, the reduction should be gradual. Since complications of treatment with glucocorticoids are dependent on the size of the dose and the duration of treatment, a risk/benefit decision must be made in each individual case as to dose and duration of treatment and as to whether daily or intermittent therapy should be used. Kaposi’s sarcoma has been reported to occur in patients receiving corticosteroid therapy, most often for chronic conditions. Discontinuation of corticosteroids may result in clinical improvement. Cardio-Renal As sodium retention with resultant edema and potassium loss may occur in patients receiving corticosteroids, these agents should be used with caution in patients with congestive heart failure, hypertension, or renal insufficiency. Endocrine Drug-induced secondary adrenocortical insufficiency may be minimized by gradual reduction of dosage. This type of relative insufficiency may persist for months after discontinuation of therapy. Therefore, in any situation of stress occurring during that period, naturally occurring glucocorticoids (hydrocortisone cortisone), which also have salt-retaining properties, rather than betamethasone, are the appropriate choices as replacement therapy in adrenocorticoal deficiency states. Gastrointestinal Steroids should be used with caution in active or latent peptic ulcers, diverticulitis, fresh intestinal anastomoses, and nonspecific ulcerative colitis, since they may increase the risk of a perforation. Signs of peritoneal irritation following gastrointestinal perforation in patients receiving corticosteroids may be minimal or absent. There is an enhanced effect of corticosteroids in patients with cirrhosis. Intra-Articular and Soft Tissue Administration Intra-articular injected corticosteroids may be systemically absorbed. Appropriate examination of any joint fluid present is necessary to exclude a septic process. A marked increase in pain accompanied by local swelling, further restriction of joint motion, fever, and malaise are suggestive of septic arthritis. If this complication occurs and the diagnosis of sepsis is confirmed, appropriate antimicrobial therapy should be instituted. Injection of a steroid into an infected site is to be avoided. Local injection of a steroid into a previously injected joint is not usually recommended. Corticosteroid injection into unstable joints is generally not recommended. Intra-articular injection may result in damage to joint tissues (see ADVERSE REACTIONS, Musculoskeletal section ). Musculoskeletal Corticosteroids decrease bone formation and increase bone resorption both through their effect on calcium regulation (i.e., decreasing absorption and increasing excretion) and inhibition of osteoblast function. This, together with a decrease in the protein matrix of the bone secondary to an increase in protein catabolism, and reduced sex hormone production, may lead to inhibition of bone growth in pediatric patients and the development of osteoporosis at any age. Special consideration should be given to patients at increased risk of osteoporosis (i.e., postmenopausal women) before initiating corticosteroid therapy. Neuro-Psychiatric Although controlled clinical trials have shown corticosteroids to be effective in speeding the resolution of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis, they do not show that they affect the ultimate outcome or natural history of the disease. The studies do show that relatively high doses of corticosteroids are necessary to demonstrate a significant effect (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). An acute myopathy has been observed with the use of high doses of corticosteroids, most often occurring in patients with disorders with neuromuscular transmission (e.g., myasthenia gravis), or in patients receiving concomitant therapy of neuromuscular blocking drugs (eg, pancuronium). This acute myopathy is generalized, may involve ocular and respiratory muscles, and may result in quadriparesis. Elevation of creatinine kinase may occur. Clinical improvement or recovery after stopping corticosteroids may require weeks to years. Psychic derangements may appear when corticosteroids are used, ranging from euphoria, insomnia, mood swings, personality changes, and severe depression to frank psychotic manifestations. Also, existing emotional instability or psychotic tendencies may be aggravated by corticosteroids. Ophthalmic Intraocular pressure may become elevated in some individuals. If steroid therapy is continued for more than 6 weeks, intraocular pressure should be monitored. Information for Patients Patients should be warned not to discontinue the use of corticosteroids abruptly or without medical supervision, to advise any medical attendants that they are taking corticosteroids and to seek medical advice at once should they develop fever or other signs of infection. Persons who are on corticosteroids should be warned to avoid exposure to chickenpox or measles. Patients should also be advised that if they are exposed, medical advice should be sought without delay. Drug Interactions Aminoglutethimide Aminoglutethimide may lead to a loss of corticosteroid-induced adrenal suppression. Amphotericin B Injection and Potassium-Depleting Agents When corticosteroids are administered concomitantly with potassium-depleting agents (ie, amphotericin B, diuretics), patients should be observed closely for development of hypokalemia. There have been cases reported in which concomitant use of amphotericin B and hydrocortisone was followed by cardiac enlargement and congestive heart failure. Antibiotics ​ Macrolide antibiotics have been reported to cause a significant decrease in corticosteroid clearance. Anticholinesterases Concomitant use of anticholinesterase agents and corticosteroids may produce severe weakness in patients with myasthenia gravis. If possible, anticholinesterase agents should be withdrawn at least 24 hours before initiating corticosteroid therapy. Anticoagulants, Oral Coadministration of corticosteroids and warfarin usually results in inhibition of response to warfarin, although there have been some conflicting reports. Therefore, coagulation indices should be monitored frequently to maintain the desired anticoagulant effect. Antidiabetics Because corticosteroids may increase blood glucose concentrations, dosage adjustments of antidiabetic agents may be required. Antitubercular Drugs Serum concentrations of isoniazid may be decreased. Cholestyramine Cholestyramine may increase the clearance of corticosteroids. Cyclosporine Increased activity of both cyclosporine and corticosteroids may occur when the two are used concurrently. Convulsions have been reported with this concurrent use. Digitalis Glycosides Patients on digitalis glycosides may be at increased risk of arrhythmias due to hypokalemia. Estrogens, Including Oral Contraceptives Estrogens may decrease the hepatic metabolism of certain corticosteroids, thereby increasing their effect. Hepatic Enzyme Inducers (e.g., barbiturates, phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampin) Drugs which induce hepatic microsomal drug-metabolizing enzyme activity may enhance the metabolism of corticosteroids and require that the dosage of the corticosteroid be increased. Ketoconazole Ketoconazole has been reported to decrease the metabolism of certain corticosteroids by up to 60%, leading to an increased risk of corticosteroid side effects. Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Agents (NSAIDS) Concomitant use of aspirin (or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents) and corticosteroids increases the risk of gastrointestinal side effects. Aspirin should be used cautiously in conjunction with corticosteroids in hypoprothrombinemia. The clearance of salicylates may be increased with concurrent use of corticosteroids. Skin Tests Corticosteroids may suppress reactions to skin tests. Vaccines Patients on prolonged corticosteroid therapy may exhibit a diminished response to toxoids and live or inactivated vaccines due to inhibition of antibody response. Corticosteroids may also potentiate the replication of some organisms contained in live attenuated vaccines. Route administration of vaccines or toxoids should be deferred until corticosteroid therapy is discontinued if possible (see WARNINGS, Infections, Vaccination section). Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility No adequate studies have been conducted in animals to determine whether corticosteroids have a potential for carcinogenesis or mutagenesis. Steroids may increase or decrease motility and number of spermatozoa in some patients. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Corticosteroids have been shown to be teratogenic in many species when given in doses equivalent to the human dose. Animal studies in which corticosteroids have been given to pregnant mice, rats, and rabbits have yielded an increased incidence of cleft palate in the offspring. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Corticosteroids should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Infants born to mothers who have received corticosteroids during pregnancy should be carefully observed for signs of hypoadrenalism. Nursing Mothers Systemically administered corticosteroids appear in human milk and could suppress growth, interfere with endogenous corticosteroid production, or cause other untoward effects. Caution should be exercised when corticosteroids are administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use The efficacy and safety of corticosteroids in the pediatric population are based on the well-established course of effect of corticosteroids, which is similar in pediatric and adult populations. Published studies provide evidence of efficacy and safety in pediatric patients for the treatment of nephrotic syndrome (> 2 years of age), and aggressive lymphomas and leukemias (> 1 month of age). Other indications for pediatric use of corticosteroids, e.g., severe asthma and wheezing, are based on adequate and well-controlled trials conducted in adults, on the premises that the course of the diseases and their pathophysiology are considered to be substantially similar in both populations. The adverse effects of corticosteroids in pediatric patients are similar to those in adults (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ). Like adults, pediatric patients should be carefully observed with frequent measurements of blood pressure, weight, height, intraocular pressure, and clinical evaluation for the presence of infection, psychosocial disturbances, thromboembolism, peptic ulcers, cataracts, and osteoporosis. Pediatric patients who are treated with corticosteroids by any route, including systemically administered corticosteroids, may experience a decrease in their growth velocity. This negative impact of corticosteroids on growth has been observed at low systemic doses and in the absence of laboratory evidence of HPA axis suppression (i.e., cosyntropin stimulation and basal cortisol plasma levels). Growth velocity may therefore be a more sensitive indicator of systemic corticosteroid exposure in pediatric patients than some commonly used tests of HPA axis function. The linear growth of pediatric patients treated with corticosteroids should be monitored, and the potential growth effects of prolonged treatment should be weighed against clinical benefits obtained and the availability of treatment alternatives. In order to minimize the potential growth effects of corticosteroids, pediatric patients should be titrated to the lowest effective dose. Geriatric Use No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between elderly subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and young patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out."

Hepatic Enzyme Inducers (e.g., barbiturates, phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampin) Drugs which induce hepatic microsomal drug-metabolizing enzyme activity may enhance the metabolism of corticosteroids and require that the dosage of the corticosteroid be increased. Ketoconazole Ketoconazole has been reported to decrease the metabolism of certain corticosteroids by up to 60%, leading to an increased risk of corticosteroid side effects. Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Agents (NSAIDS) Concomitant use of aspirin (or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents) and corticosteroids increases the risk of gastrointestinal side effects. Aspirin should be used cautiously in conjunction with corticosteroids in hypoprothrombinemia. The clearance of salicylates may be increased with concurrent use of corticosteroids. Skin Tests Corticosteroids may suppress reactions to skin tests. Vaccines Patients on prolonged corticosteroid therapy may exhibit a diminished response to toxoids and live or inactivated vaccines due to inhibition of antibody response. Corticosteroids may also potentiate the replication of some organisms contained in live attenuated vaccines. Route administration of vaccines or toxoids should be deferred until corticosteroid therapy is discontinued if possible (see WARNINGS, Infections, Vaccination section)."
